The City is focused on the proposed IT Strategic Plan as the cornerstone of our efforts to improve the balance between demand for more and better technology, innovation, and security, and available IT resources, capital, and operating funds.\n\nThe City’s last IT Strategic Plan was completed in 2015.  The City is primarily motivated to develop an IT Strategic Plan to continue to provide appropriate support, security, and resiliency in an evolving IT landscape and in consideration of expanding end points in the City.  \n\nThis work is planned for FY23-FY24 to help address the growing number of devices, data, systems and IT Help Calls and the plan is expected to provide a roadmap for the FY25 budget and beyond.\n\nBusiness Need\n\nThe IT Strategic Plan should inform many important decisions in the City such as when and what to move to the cloud, industry best practices to secure cloud and on premise systems, data governance, how to best prepare for and respond to supply chain vulnerabilities and cyber supply chain risk management, and how to streamline and monitor disparate systems to best apply security and provide support in the future.  An analysis of IT’s customer business needs is central to this work.\n\nProject Complexity\n\nData collection from approximately 650  IT users (survey tool potential), technical expertise on cyber security, cloud systems, and emerging technology trends as well as any implementation challenges, project is fixed cost.\n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nProject Manager: Chief Information Officer \n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nThe City is organized into 11 departments and 4 constitutional offices which can be seen in the organizational chart below.

To fulfill this mission, DCJS:\n\nThe agency’s primary constituents are local and state criminal justice agencies and practitioners, private security practitioners and businesses, and the public-at-large. Other constituents include local governments and state agencies, the federal government and advocacy groups/associations.\n\nThe Division of Licensure and Regulatory Services (DLRS) involves the oversight and enforcement of five statutory and regulatory programs.  DLRS is dedicated to providing excellent customer service to its constituents and professionals serving the private side of public safety.  The statutory and regulatory programs are as follows:  \n\n- Private Security Services\n\t- Security Officers (Armed and Unarmed)\n\t- Private Investigators\n\t- Armored Car Personnel\n\t- Electronic Security Technicians\n\t- Electronic Sales Representatives\n\t- Central Station Dispatchers\n\t- Personal Protection Specialists (Bodyguards)\n\t- Locksmiths\n\t- Businesses\n\t- Training Schools\n\t- Compliance Agents\n\t- Instructors\n- Bail Bondsmen (Surety and Property)\n- Bail Enforcement Agents (Bounty Hunters)\n- Special Conservator of the Peace\n- Tow Truck Drivers\n\nDLRS currently has a credential management system which was implemented in 2015.  It offers a back-office application that staff uses to manage applications, an online portal that customers use to submit applications, an online portal that training schools use to submit class rosters, it interfaces with a third party online portal that individuals/businesses use to pay required fees, and interfaces to Fieldprint and the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for photo IDs, fingerprints, and accessing DMV driving records.\n\nBusiness Need \n\nDCJS has started the process for replacing their existing custom credential management system with a packaged solution. Ahead of the project, DCJS seeks to assess their current business processes and look for opportunities to make them more efficient and streamlined.\n\nProject Complexity\n\nThis project is of moderate complexity and risk due to the following factors:\n\n1. Project requirements and business rule documentation for the system replacement have been completed as part of the RFP for the new credential management system. \n2. Current business process inventory does not exist. As part of this engagement, process inventory and high-priority processes must be identified to define the scope for this engagement.\n3. The risk is not updating the processes to a “future” state because staff/selected supplier engagement is low, and the potential challenges related to coordinating desk level interviews due to remote work and reliance on Microsoft Teams. This could result in poorly designed target-state processes for the next project (system replacement) and, ultimately, an inefficient system upgrade.  However, the Division believes that they can mitigate the risk related to remote work while conducting the project.\n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nThe agency IT team is comprised of a Chief Technology Officer, an Information Security Officer, two Project Managers, two System Administrators, two Help Desk Technicians, five Developers, and a DBA.  The project will require input from the Division of Licensure and Regulatory Services, which is depicted in the agency organizational chart below.\n\n\n\n1. __Scope of Work:__\n\n<a id=\"OLE_LINK10\"></a>This Statement of Requirements (SOR) defines the services required by the Authorized User in support of the DCJS Licensing and Credential Management Process Improvement project.

The purpose of this document is to list the minimum requirements for a database system for the Division, to provide guidelines for evaluating existing applications and planning for future enhancements. Please note that this is a portion of a larger project.  There is an opportunity for the selected vendor to provide support for the remaining phases of this project, depending on performance.\n\nDNR would prefer the system to be developed using the Salesforce platform, but we are open to other solutions that would meet these requirements. Depending on the solution, the selected vendor may work with IOT to secure appropriate licenses. \n\nDNR prefers to use an agile methodology on all modules and development work identified in Phase 1 Group A first would be implemented then during the initial implementation, DNR would prefer Phase 1 Group B modules be developed and implemented in a similar fashion. However, DNR is also open to other development strategies.\n\nThis is the first iteration of a larger project and will need to be included to interact with future iterations. \n\n- \n\t- Total Duration (Months)\n\t- 6-Months\n\t- Drivers for IT Services Needs\n\t- Replacing the legacy system \n\n1. __Acronyms/Definitions   \n__\n\n- GIS – Geographic Information Systems\n- IOT – Indiana Office of Technology\n- SSO- Single Sign On\n- ATS – Application Tracking System\n- ESRI- Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc\n- CTS – Correspondence Tracking System\n- VTS – Violations Tracking System\n- FEMA – Federal Emergency Management Agency\n- SEA – Senate Enrolled Act\n- WR&U Section – Water Rights & Use Section\n- GW- Ground Water\n- SW- Surface Water\n- TRS- Township, range, section\n- WDPI – Well Driller & Pump Installer\n- SWWF – Significant Water Withdrawal Facility\n- USGS – United States Geological Survey\n- DOW – Division of Water\n- NFIP – National Flood Insurance Program\n- LOMC – Letters of Map Change \n- QC – Quality Check\n- IEAP – Incident Emergency Action Plan\n- GN – General Request\n- FARA – Floodplain Analysis and Regulatory Assessment\n- INFIP- Indiana Floodplain Information Portal \n- BAFL – Best Available Floodplain Layer\n\n1. __IT Project Scope of Work__\n\nThe SOI requires IT services for the project described in Section 1, “IT Project Identification” above.\n\nInformation Technology services required from the IT Vendor shall include:\n\nThe overall requirements of the database system should include the following:\n\n1.

It is organized as a separate department of government with delegated administrative, legislative, and judicial powers. SCC regulatory decisions can only be appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court. \n\nThe State Corporation Commission’s Division of Securities and Retail Franchising (“Division”)  regulates the offer and sale of securities, investment advice and franchises, and facilitates the registration of securities and trademarks and service marks.\n\nThe Division is responsible for administering the Securities Act, the Retail Franchising Act, and the Trademark and Service Mark Act.  In administering these Acts, the overall mission of the Division is to protect the public by promoting a fair and stable marketplace of investment products and services through education, compliance and enforcement, while enhancing economic growth.\n\nThe Division’s staffing has remained relatively stable for many years and currently has 43 edicated, knowledgeable employees. The Division is led by a director with 50\\+ years of experience supported by 4 sections: Registration, Examinations, Audit and Investigations.  Excluding the Director, staff experience level is over 13 years. Three new employees were hired in the last year with more expected as retirements increase. As such, transfer of knowledge and streamlined documented processes are key strategies to ensure continuity of operations. \n\nThe Division has adapted well to recent organizational changes including a new Deputy Director, addition of 3 new Principals (front line supervisors and Subject matter experts); and consolidation of 2 sections, Enforcement and Investigations, into one. Staff engagement is high and open to process improvements prior to another strategic priority, modernizing our division system.\n\nBusiness Need\n\nThe Division has decided to modernize its work processes in order to gain efficiencies, enhance performance, and lay the foundation for managed business processes. The Division has decided to undertake this effort in part due to the desire to align with SCC’s goal of instituting repeatable and predictable business processes to enable high performance, as well as to prepare for the upcoming upgrade of the Divisions’ workflow system, SERFIS.  It is in this context that the SCC now seeks outside support to assist in achieving this future state. \n\n \n\nThe SCC requires an analysis of the processes related to the Division to identify opportunities for improved performance and productivity. \n\n \n\nThe intent of this engagement is to create the Deliverables detailed below. The execution of resulting Deliverables is not in scope. The SCC may, in its sole discretion, issue a subsequent Statement of Requirements for services related to the execution of resulting Deliverables. \n\n \n\nTables I and II below include the SCC’s assessment of necessary Deliverables and Deliverables Examples, as applicable.  However, the SCC will consider alternative or additional Deliverables (and associated timelines as applicable) as proposed and specifically described by Suppliers.  \n\nProject Complexity\n\nThe project complexity is medium, as is the risk.  The division has process documentation as it relates to our current, old system (SERFIS) though it may not be entirely up to date. The risk is not updating the processes to a “to be” state because staff/vendor engagement is low, the time and coordination of desk level interviews due to remote work and reliance on Microsoft teams. This could result poorly designed systems requirements and an inefficient system upgrade. \n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nOutlined in 13 B. The divisions Deputy director will serve as executive sponsor and our Systems Supervisor will have the business lead role. The expectation will be to have weekly check point meetings via MT if not in person, to ensure the timelines are being met and there is open communication from both Division and Vendor perspective. \n\n1. __Scope of Work:__\n\nThis SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  \n\n__Table I - Deliverables__\n\n__Description__\n\n__Activities__\n\n__Deliverable Items__\n\nAs-Is Process Analysis\n\n \n\n \n\nConduct As-Is Process Analysis\n\n1.

Currently, DWSRF data is tracked within siloed systems and tools including: a system over 14 years old and manually tracked in spreadsheets and other documents resulting in timely processes and reporting challenges. To facilitate administration of the program and support the public health, the Virginia DWSRF program completed an effort to identify business and technology opportunities that will improve operational efficiency, allow more accurate reporting and analysis, facilitate planning and support better decision making.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, the program is looking to modernize and implement a system that allows standardization across the various groups withing the DWSRF program, provides a central data repository while ensuring data quality, allows for integrated document management and facilitates reporting and decision making. \n\nBusiness Need\n\nThe Virginia DWSRF program supports the public health and quality of life for all citizens of the Commonwealth. It is imperative that the program has the right tools to manage funded projects, and availability to complete accurate and timely data for reporting and decision making.\n\nThe program has established processes and tools; however, operational gaps were identified as part of the assessment efforts and recommendations provided to help the program mature and achieve more operational efficiency including the standardization of tools, processes and project management methodology across regions and teams within the program.\n\nThe DWSRF Program is seeking a vendor partner to help:\n\n- Analyze six (6) current state processes within the program to provide process improvement recommendations and define a future state that allows for efficiency and standardization across regions and teams.\n- Establish a project governance framework across the program. This includes standardize templates, tools, and new processes across regions. Also define a document structure to help consolidate a portal for PMO tools, documentation, and training material \n\nProject Complexity\n\nThis project is estimated to be medium complexity and low risk.  The Supplier will be tasked with gathering and documenting high level requirements, analyzing current state, designing future state and implementing changes that support the Virginia DWSRF program’s long-term vision and goals.\n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nThe supplier is required to provide dedicated project management, including creation and management of the Project Schedule.  Section 21 outlines the requirements for project metrics (risks, issues, action items, etc.) to be tracked and included in the status reports.  All project meetings will have notes taken and communicated to the project team. Action items should be verbally identified at the project meeting and included (or referenced, if tracked separately) in the meeting notes. \n\n1. __Scope of Work:__\n\nThis SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  The scope of this project is to analyze and implement standardization of business processes, project management and training efforts across the DWSRF Program. The analysis will produce a high level ‘As Is’ document that will serve as the project baseline. The team will then formulate a strategic ‘To Be’ plan including recommendations and implement the changes to the program.", "sourcePath": "processedDocs/vdh-office-of-drinking-water-virginia-department-of-health-vdh-o.md"}

VDH received many questions during Vendor Q&A; as some of these questions are still pertinent to the scope of this SOR, that Q&A document has been included as a reference attachment (*VDH\\_SOR\\_Agency Grant Management System Vendor Q&A - Original SOR VDH-221025-01-CAI.docx*). \n\nProject History\n\nThe agency is currently using Microsoft Office Excel and Word to document and manage grant activity. These tools do not have the capabilities to support necessary improvements to communications, processes, analysis or the reporting required to serve the Commonwealth at a higher level.\n\nBusiness Need\n\nIt is imperative that the agency has the right application to manage grant activities to support accurate analysis, timely reporting and decision making. Agency teams have established processes and tools; however, after a current state assessment, many opportunities to improve operational efficiency were identified. As a result of these efforts, the program is looking to modernize and implement an application that allows standardization across the various groups, supports required integrations to financial systems and provides a central data repository that allows for integrated document management for 30 plus users (this may increase) with the following roles: Grant Administrators, Accountants, Procurement/General Services Specialists, and Agency Grant Specialists.\n\nProject Complexity\n\nBecause of the agency team’s operational maturity level, the number of groups represented, the allocated budget and the required system integrations, this project is estimated to be high complexity and low risk. Vendors will be tasked with reviewing and analyzing agency provided requirements and assisting with their refinement to ultimately design and implement an approved solution.\n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nTo ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the defined scope; VDH’s Office of Information Management will assign a Project Manager and a Business Analyst/Technical Lead to coordinate activities and ensure all work is performed and meets the agency’s expectations. In addition, an Information Security Officer will be assigned to the project to ensure the security standards of the Commonwealth of Virginia are upheld.  VDH Business Owners and Subject Matter Experts will be responsible for overall validation of the project. A Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) Project Management Division (PMD) representative will be assigned and responsible for project oversight and governance. Vendors will provide a dedicated project manager who will be required to develop a proposed schedule, attend scheduled meetings and submit regular status reports. Vendors will submit all work to designated VDH agency staff responsible for project oversight, technical development, and business approval.  VDH technical and business staff will be available to support the Vendors’ project team to address issues and concerns.\n\n- Weekly Status Meetings:  These meetings will be used as an opportunity for the project team, key stakeholders and the vendors to review current statuses, risks and issues, and the project schedule. \n- Stand-Ups: At a minimum frequency of twice a week, delivery team members will spend a total of 15 minutes reporting to each other and identifying needs. Each team member summarizes what they did in previous days, what they are currently working on, and what challenges they face if any. The project managers will be responsible for addressing any challenges and escalating the challenges when necessary.\n- Inter-Agency Oversight Committee (IAOC) Meetings: To ensure delivery governance and stewardship, an oversight committee made up of VDH Executive Leadership (Deputy Commissioner of Administration, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Information Officer), a VITA PMD representative, the VDH Project Manager and Vendor Project Managers/Delivery Lead. This committee will be responsible for hearing progress reports, reviewing identified risks & issues, removing blockers & impediments, and address any other business. They will also be responsible for approving any proposed changes to the scope, schedule and or budget. This meeting will be scheduled by the VDH Project Manager and held monthly.\n\n1. __Scope of Work:__\n\nThis SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service. The scope of this project is to implement a modern grant management application solution that can be maintained by VDH without additional vendor support and includes:\n\n- Project Management\n- Requirement analysis and refinement \n- Application Design\n- Application Development and/or configuration\n- Application Integrations with 3rd party systems\n- Excel Data Uploads\n- Assistance with User Acceptance Testing\n- Training\n- Application Security Implementation\n- Production Deployment and knowledge transfer\n\nBelow are more details of the project scope.

Each proposal can be hundreds of pages. It is a critical step in the process to launch a new construction project. Today, staff members from Central Office as well as from the Districts access what is known as the CNSP (Copied Notes Special Provisions) software system to select and gather construction specifications then build proposals for a given project.  This MS Access application builds 100% of the draft proposals when used.   When it is working correctly, the application saves a lot of manual work and time to create a draft contract proposal.\n\nBusiness Need\n\nThe CNSP system is outdated, unreliable, and causes a lot of rework in a time sensitive process. Construction estimates that 40% of attempted builds fail during the process, resulting in rework.  When downtime and rework is significant, it can result in delays to projects achieving the scheduled advertisement date. CNSP is homegrown by Construction and there is no built-in IT support for repairs or maintenance. This system needs to be replaced with a solution that will provide the same functionality but will function as designed without issues.  \n\nProject Complexity\n\nThis project is Low Risk and Low Complexity. \n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nThe VDOT Project Manager and the Supplier Project Manager are the main VDOT points of contact and are responsible for day-to-day management of the application solution.\n\nMore Specifically:\n\n1. Supplier shall appoint a project manager.\n2. The Supplier project manager shall report to the VDOT project manager.\n3. VDOT project manager shall escalate issues needing Supplier attention to the Supplier project manager, who will escalate within Supplier’s organization as needed.\n4. Supplier project manager shall copy the VDOT project manager on all communications with VDOT staff.\n5. __Scope of Work:__\n\nThis SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service. \n\nIn Scope:\n\n- Supplier will provide the following services:\n\t- Create replacement CNSP application using Microsoft Dynamics 365 as the application platform.\n\t- Provide information regarding license types and quantity count for the intended solution.\n\t- Configure Dynamics 365 to provide all functionality required; no custom development is desired outside of native power platform functionality.\n\t- Configure every aspect needed for the final delivered solution including security, user profiles, etc. \n\t- Utilize the VDOT Dynamics 365 development and test environments.\n\t- Develop the use cases, user stories, user acceptance test cases and acceptance criteria for testing the new CNSP application, and coordinate user acceptance testing with end user testers.\n\t- Work with VDOT infrastructure personnel to deploy the new CNSP application in VDOT’s Dynamics 365 environment.\n\t- Follow VDOT standards described in the Enterprise Architecture Supplemental Statement of Requirements attachment.\n\t- Provide one to three months post-production support.  Suppliers should propose the support period in their SOW response.\n- Supplier will provide status updates at a weekly project team meeting to be scheduled by Authorized User, to include status reviews and/or reports describing the release progress, daily/weekly accomplishments, and upcoming tasks for the next reporting period, risks, issues, dependencies, and any other information the Supplier feels is necessary to represent the status of the project.\n- The Authorized User’s external SharePoint site will be utilized for document management in support of implementation. \n- Quality metrics shall be provided by the Supplier, to include, but not limited to:  \n\t- Performance Measurement and Reporting – The Supplier will communicate overall project status, technical issues and accomplishments, schedule performance, cost and schedule issues, and corrective action plans, as appropriate or directed by Authorized User.\n\t- Testing - The Supplier will communicate number of test cases created, number of test cases executed, number of defects reported, number of defects remediated, and percentage of test cases passed for the System Integration Test and User Acceptance Test.\n\nSee VDOT’s Enterprise Architecture Supplemental Statement of Requirements document referenced in the Appendix for VDOT policies, standards, and documentation requirements for application development. \n\nFunctional Requirements\n\nThe CNSP application is used to create a new draft proposal, triggered when all the pertinent information is available to begin the process and a project is identified as being included in an upcoming ad.  The current process steps are:\n\n1. Select the “Contract Type”.\n2. Use the data from pre-construction to generate the “Merge” form.\n3. Click on the “Update Document Listing” button (if that had not been updated within the past several days).\n4. Select which “Copied Notes” and “Special Provisions” items to be appended to the proposed contract by utilizing pick list items.\n5. Save the data entered and the items picked.\n6. Press the “Build” button.\n7. Fix formatting issues and add remaining items to the contract proposal to complete the process.\n\nSee the final Business Requirements document, detailed requirements matrix (user stories & acceptance criteria), and embedded documents listed in the Appendix for additional details.  \n\nTechnical Requirements\n\nVDOT is looking for a Supplier to implement Dynamics 365 for a currently manual / Access-driven process.\n\nCurrent State Diagram\n\n\n\nIn short, the business uses Access and VBA to help assemble a collection of Word documents that are stored in SharePoint Online. These documents are ordered and indexed (non-numbered) by the VBA script, which exports a compiled Word document. After performing any needed edits to the Word document, the user exports the document as a pdf and appends any other pdf attachments.\n\nOur desired future state is to transition this to Microsoft Dynamics 365 and use native Dynamics functionality.\n\nFuture State Diagram\n\n\n\nOur suggested solution path is described as follows: The user initiates document creation in 365 Dynamics. The first 10 or so pages of the document ", "sourcePath": "processedDocs/vdot-construction-division-virginia-department-of-transportation.md"}

VDOT recognized the need to replace these outdated HR systems with an integrated Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM) solution to enable VDOT growth and to support Agency initiatives.  \n\nVDOT has selected Oracle HCM Cloud Services as our HCM solution. This solution is a comprehensive, modernized, and user friendly Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system that automates all of VDOT’s desired HR functions and provides the best value based on business needs versus product capabilities and cost. \n\nVDOT is currently in the process of procuring the following:   \n\nOracle Cloud Service\n\nSKU\\#\n\nFusion Human Capital Management  Base Cloud Service \n\nB85800\n\nFusion Human Resources Help Desk Cloud Service\n\nB87388\n\nFusion Recruiting Cloud Service\n\nB87675\n\nPolicy Automation for Workers Cloud Service\n\nB88872\n\nFusion Workforce Health and Safety Incidents Cloud Service\n\nB89482\n\nFusion Talent Management and Workforce Compensation Cloud Service\n\nB91066\n\nAdditional Test Environment for Oracle Fusion Cloud Service\n\nB84490  \n\nHIPAA Advanced Security for Fusion Oracle Public Cloud\n\nB87365\n\nFusion for the United States Government Cloud\n\nB87366\n\nRightNow Cloud Platform for United States Government Cloud Service\n\nB69333\n\nRightNow HIPAA Cloud Platform Service      \n\nB85994\n\n__Business Need__\n\nVDOT has custom built most of its HR systems that support HR activities for the entire Agency.  The current HR Works\\! platform* *is currently built on unsupported or soon to be unsupported technologies including SharePoint 2010 and K2 4.69. It is implemented with custom code that not only results in operational complexity but in difficulties implementing future business changes, additional functionality and updates. \n\nVDOT seeks to replace the HR Works\\! platform and other standalone HR applications with the Oracle HCM Cloud Services, as it is expensive to sustain currently and would require significant ongoing investment to move and maintain in the Cloud.  \n\nOracle HCM Cloud Services will benefit all VDOT employees and management by unifying and simplifying many HR services in the following areas: Talent Acquisition & Onboarding; Compensation, Performance Management, Personnel Files and Core HR and Administrative functions.  The solution will be used across the agency by all staff responsible for this business function as well as all VDOT employees and potential candidates.  Current VDOT HR processes in HR Works\\! are manual and with this solution, will be automated and encourage increased employee self-service (ESS).  \n\nThis effort will support the COVA Strategic Plan goal to manage and direct the evaluation and adoption of cloud computing to address agency business requirements for a secure, flexible, economical, and rapidly scalable computing environment. In addition, this effort supports the Governor’s priorities to encourage innovation and research, and to make our government accessible and efficiently managed.\n\n__Project Complexity and Risk__\n\nThis project is considered high risk with high complexity, due to the sensitivity and criticality of the employee data captured and the integration points across multiple data sources and destination within the current HR environment and ecosystem.  During the project, Supplier will provide regular communications to Authorized User regarding the risks to ensure any increased risks are quickly identified and reviewed.  \n\n__Project Management and Organizational Structure__\n\nThe HCM Cloud Implementation project is managed as a Commonwealth of Virginia major IT project.  The project is managed through the VDOT Information Technology Division (ITD), with input from the Human Resources Division Administrator as the business owner.  A Steering Committee will be established to monitor and govern the implementation of this project.\n\n\n\n1. __Scope:__\n\nThis SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  \n\n__PLEASE NOTE:  This SOR includes the scope for the full implementation of the Oracle HCM solution.  Phases 1 and 2 of the project are currently being delivered under a previous SOW that was executed.  This SOR is being reissued to solicit the SOW for Phase 3 only.  The Phase 3 scope will be narrowly defined in the new SOW.__\n\n1. __In Scope:__\n\n- Supplier will provide pre-defined standard business processes for the Oracle HCM Cloud Services based on their best practice methodology that has been utilized to provide clients with the context, understanding and expertise to successfully meet their HR objectives.\n- Authorized User will leverage the out-of-the-box functionality from Oracle HCM Cloud services to the greatest extent possible in order to limit extensive configuration.\n- Supplier will customize the standard business processes based on priority of the workflow needs of the Authorized User’s Human Resources organization.\n- The major HR functions that will be delivered in this SOR include:\n- Talent Acquisition & On-boarding\n- Compensation\n- Performance Management\n- Off-boarding\n- Personnel Files\n- Core HR and Administrative\n- Out-of-the-box Reporting\n\n1. __Out of Scope:__\n\n- Any other HR functions and processes to include: \n\t- Benefits\n\t- Payroll\n\t- Cash Management\n\t- Learning\n- Retirement of HRWorks\\! and standalone HR applications\n- Integration with other HR systems will be completed by Authorized User\n\n1. __Requirement Details:__\n\n__Approach and Timeline__\n\nFinal timeline to be finalized with the Supplier prior to execution of the SOW.  VDOT is targeting a May 10, 2021 project start date and project completion within 16-24 months.\n\nA multiple phase approach is needed to reduce the complexity, each with its own deployment, which aims for some of VDOT’s HR applications to be sunset earlier.  \n\nThis SOR contains details about the Oracle HCM Cloud modules that will be implemented at VDOT within a multi-year effort. \n\n- A single supplier will be awarded implementation of all modules. Suppliers responding to this SOR should  ensure that their SOW response include their approach and pricing for analysis and planning as well as phased implementations. \n- This will allow the Authorized User to ne", "sourcePath": "processedDocs/vdot-human-resources-virginia-department-of-transportation-vdot.md"}

To resolve this problem, the photos shall be posted in the HMMS work order generated from the CSC service request.\n\t-  This enables field partners to determine the situational awareness, priority of the work, tools and the number of technicians required for the job.\n\t- This also enables the field partners to save time from driving to location to analyze the intensity of the problem.\n\t- This shall also enable customers to have confidence if the photos attached to the service request are passed to the field workers since there will be no back and forth misunderstanding between customer and field worker.\n\nBusiness Objectives:\n\n- The field partners shall be able to have the clear understanding of the problem indicated in the service request created by the customer.\n- The photos shall be posted in the HMMS work order generated from the CSC service request.\n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nThe VDOT support manager(s) and the Vendor Support Manager are the main VDOT points of contact and are responsible for day-to-day management of the application solution.\n\nVDOT will appoint up to one support manager per application and one for the platform.\n\n1. __Scope of Work:__\n\nThis SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  \n\n  \n\n1. The scope of the project is to pass the photos that are submitted by the customer as attachments in the service request form in Customer Service Center (CSC 3.0) to HMMS.\n2. The photos shall be passed and attached to the HMMS work order in the form of documents that are associated to the Service Request in the CSC. \n3. The photos that are being attached in the CSC Service Request are now being stored in Microsoft Dynamics and vendor shall develop a SSIS package to pass the photos from CSC service request to HMMS work order. \n\t- Note: The HMMS work order are currently stored in VUEWorks and shall leverage the existing functionality for accessing the attachments & Images.\n4. The notification email related to the work order sent to the user shall need to be modified with notification of Images attached in the work order.\n\nNote: Body of the email shall need to be updated with the information of Images attached in the work order.\n\n__Business Requirements:__\n\n1. Photos that are attached to the Customer Service Center (CSC) Service request (SR) shall be passed to the Highway Maintenance Management System (HMMS) and attached to the work order.\n\t1. Photos that are passed from the CSC Service request to the HMMS work order shall be viewable to the field partners from the work order.  Simply associating it with the service request ID in HMMS is not acceptable, as the field partners generally access work orders, not SR's.\n\t\t1. System currently enables user to attach photos while creating the Service Request in the CSC.\n\t\t2. System currently converts the CSC service request to work order in the HMMS that can be accessible to the field partners.\n\t\t3. System shall pass the photos that are attached in the CSC service request to the HMMS work order during the work order conversion.\n\t\t4. System shall enable field partners to view the photos in the work order that are passed from CSC service request.\n\t2. DOTi, VDOT's intranet, currently accepts a single attachment up to 6mb of size. This integration must be able to accept the larger attachments if the limit is changed in the future.\n\t\t1. System shall enable user to attach one photo or file up to 6mb of size to CSC service request.\n\t\t2. System shall be able to attach the photos to the HMMS work order up to 6mb of size.\n\t\t3. System shall be able to attach the photos of larger size to HMMS work order if the attachment size is increased for CSC service request.\n2. User to be notified in an email from HMMS that the work order is attached with images.\n\t1. The HMMS notification email related to the work order sent to the HMMS user must include the text to inform the user that an image is associated with the work order, and preferably will include a hyperlink to the picture.\n\t\t1. System shall be able to send email notification to the user when a work order generated.\n\t\t2. System shall include the information regarding the image attached to the work order in the body of the email notification sent to the user.\n3. Duplicate service requests with the images shall be linked to the parent work order.\n\t1. If duplicate services requests with photos attached are submitted in CSC, all the images of the child service requests (duplicate service requests) shall be linked to the parent work order that is created from parent service request.\n\nNote: Currently, duplicate Service requests are converted to child service requests and are linked to the parent work order. The functionality remains same with the Photos as well.\n\n- \n\t- \n\t\t1. System shall be able to create duplicate service requests.\n\t\t2. System shall be able to generate all the duplicate service requests as child service requests and link to the parent work order, generated from parent service request.\n\t\t3. System shall be able to link all the images of the child service requests to the parent work order that is parent service request.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- \n\t- Permits HMMS field users to view customer-submitted artifacts without having to log into another system.\n\t- Reduced licensing costs as MS Dynamics seats are not consumed.\n\t- Uncouples dependency on CSC’s ownership/retention to Photo artifacts of HMMS WOs\n\t- Users are able to view attachments using HMMS native features \n\n1.

There is no way to easily gain insight into statuses, capacity, or other information needed for the strategic management of professional services consultant contracts, including future planning, quality assurance, and compliance. Furthermore, there is no centralized location for all VDOT staff to view the active, open or closed contracts. As a result, PSPO does not have access to the necessary documents and data on agency professional services consultant contracts. \n\n \n\nProject Complexity\n\nMedium to High Risk\n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nThe VDOT Project Manager and the Supplier Project Manager are the main VDOT points of contact and are responsible for day-to-day management of the application solution. \n\n \n\nMore Specifically: \n\n1.

This is expected to be a long-term engagement to sustain the OT cybersecurity program through routine and ongoing support. The Agency desires consistency in the ongoing support and minimal staffing turnover to ensure a cohesive and uninterrupted development of operations.\n\n__Current State __\n\nVDOT is currently using Icinga to monitor the availability of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) devices and CalemEAM is integrated with Icinga and is the current service and asset management solution for these devices. ITS device monitoring is supported by an Integrated Service Desk (ISD), also referred to as the ITS Network Operations Center (NOC) which supports the monitoring and asset responsive activities. VDOT also uses its Highway Maintenance Management System (HMMS) as the asset management tool for traffic signals and is largely dependent on sources outside of VDOT for traffic signal anomaly notifications.\n\n__Future State __\n\nVDOT is expanding its monitoring and asset management efforts to include all operations technology (OT) assets. VDOT is implementing the TOSC to support the OT device availability monitoring, OT network device, security monitoring and associated responsive maintenance activities. VDOT is implementing a more comprehensive asset management platform named the Operations Technology Services and Asset Management (OTSaAM). The OTSaAM asset management system will provide VDOT the full range of asset management services to include: inventory, monitoring, change management, status reporting, maintenance tracking, asset operations and maintenance data analysis and asset attribute management. \n\nThe two primary control systems which will ultimately interface with the OTSaAM platform are the Advanced Traffic Management System, or ATMS (OpenTMS) and the Statewide Traffic Signal System, or STSS (KITS). These control systems take in alerts, new device information, and new user information from OTSaAM and export device status, device failures, device type, asset ID, and failed login attempts to OTSaAM.\n\nThe TOSC will consist of both the NOC and Security Operations Center (SOC) staff.  The Authorized User has chosen to issue two separate Statements of Requirements for NOC and SOC support Please see additional SOR for Security Operations Center (SOC) Support for additional information. These entities are separately defined; however, they will be co-located to facilitate necessary interaction. SOC and NOC staff will work cooperatively to triage alerts and anomalies and bring them to resolution using VDOT processes and procedures. \n\nThe following are the primary NOC functions of the TOSC:\n\n- TOSC NOC uses device data from OTSaAM to validate authorized devices on the network\n- TOSC NOC uses network monitoring tools to monitor the health of the Operations Technology Network and associated devices\n- TOSC NOC coordinates responses for ITS/Signal device failures, communication network device failures, fiber cable breaks, etc.\n- TOSC NOC responds to anomalies and prioritizes needed actions for Work Orders for maintenance and upgrades\n\n\t\n\nThe primary tools integrated into OTSaAM and used by the TOSC NOC Operator to accomplish device management and to monitor responsive maintenance activities are:\n\n- Icinga (OT edge device monitoring)\n- ClearAsset (OT asset management tool)\n\nOSPInsight (OT fiber network management tool) is used by the TOSC NOC Operator; however, it is not integrated into OTSaAM.\n\nMedco XTWeb (digital key and locks management tool) is also used by the TOSC NOC Operator and is not integrated into OTSaAM.\n\nVDOT will use ClearAsset as the backbone of the OTSaAM asset management platform and will use it to manage all OT devices. ClearAsset is an enterprise asset and maintenance management software to monitor, inventory, track and maintain OT assets across the Commonwealth to reduce costs, enhance safety and improve efficiency. ClearAsset contains an Inventory module and a Trouble Ticket (work order) system to track asset anomalies from notification through resolution.\n\nVDOT needs support for the TOSC NOC and associated OT device management and maintenance services. Other stakeholders include field maintenance contractors who are dispatched to respond to maintenance work orders. Authorized User is in the process of procuring these contract services statewide. TOSC NOC operational support includes monitoring for systems, network and device anomalies. The mission of the TOSC NOC is to help keep secure and maintain all OT devices at a high level of functionality. The TOSC is a 24x7x365 operations center comprised of a network operations center (NOC) and security operations center (SOC) dedicated to actively monitoring and managing all operations technology (OT) network and devices. OTSaAM is comprised of an integration of Icinga and ClearAsset but, will account for all OT device inventory to include:\n\n- Five (5) Traffic Operations Centers IT and network infrastructure and environment\n- ITS Field Devices and associated communications network components (e.g., switches, routers, firewalls, etc.)\n- Traffic Signal Devices and associated communications network components (e.g., switches, routers, firewalls, UPS, etc.)\n- Statewide Communications Network to include wireless, wired, Fiber Plant and network of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexers (DWDM)\n- Statewide cloud-based environment and components - Azure\n\n__Project Management and Organizational Structure__\n\nOversight of the resulting Scope of Work will be performed by the Traffic Operations Division (TOD) TOSC Manager with support from Subject Matter Experts (SME): Traffic Operations Division Representative and Operations Technology Division Representative. Transportation Systems Strategy Office (TSSO) Representatives will serve as Project Sponsors.

VDH wants to ensure compliance with the current versions of the COV’s IT Security Standards (SEC530) as well as ensure compliance with COV’s IT Security IT Audit Standards (SEC502).  The Commonwealth of Virginia’s Information Security Standard, SEC 530 (Security Standard) adopts the Information System Security Control Families (families) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Security Standard uses these families to organize the controls that the Commonwealth is required to apply to its information systems. \n\nAccording to NIST, a family “contains security controls related to the general security topic of the family. Security controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision, manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms implemented by information systems and devices.”\n\nBusiness Need\n\nThe Office of Internal Audit’s IT Department, VDH Office of Internal Audit requires auditing of its systems in accordance with the FY24 IT Audit Plan on file with VITA. \n\nThe systems in scope for this SOR are:\n\n- OEPI – ELR Database (ELR) \n- OEPI – HIV Counseling, Testing & Referral (HIV-CTR) \n- OEPI – VASE/VASE\\+ \n- OFHS – Care Connection for Children System Users Network (CCC-SUN) – if time permits\n\nThe data owners, system owners, and VDH’s Office of Compliance and Security have identified these systems as sensitive.  As such, the Commonwealth’s IT Security Standard requires a SEC530 IT Security Compliance audit once every three years.\n\nVDH requires final audit deliverables by June 30, 2024.\n\nProject Complexity\n\nProject complexity and risk are assessed as moderate.\n\nProject Management and Organizational Structure\n\nVDH Internal Audit Director will be the lead for this effort.  The Supplier will provide deliverables to the Audit Director.  \n\n1. __Scope of Work: __\n\nThis SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  In connection with the Services, the Supplier will perform the following tasks in the course of the audit: \n\nA.\tIT Security Audit Process\n\n1.

CACSG is used by Virginia Tax to facilitate the collection of delinquent tax fees from individual taxpayers and businesses. \n\nCACSG automates the collection and case management workflow, automatically performing functions such as generating correspondence to taxpayers, monitoring the status of payment plans, and generating daily work lists detailing those collection items that require further activity by Collections personnel. CACSG has also centralized case management by consolidating information regarding taxpayer contacts, debts, assets, payment plans, and past collection activities. \n\nThe Computer Assisted Collections System for Government for Court Debt Collections (“CACSG-CDCO”) is an associated application that is similar to CACSG but uses a separate database. The two applications share server platforms and operate in the same Information Security controls environment. CACSG-CDCO is used by the Court Debt Collections Office (“CDCO”). CDCO has been charged with collecting outstanding court debts on behalf of the Commonwealth’s judicial branch. \n\nAccess to CACSG, and CACSG-CDCO, is handled by the single sign-on process, Tax Authority, which grants users the capability to access multiple IRMS applications through a central authentication application. <a id=\"_Hlk148694914\"></a>The CACSG system architecture consists primarily of Linux servers and utilizes an Oracle database.\n\n*PASS*\n\nPASS is an Audit Selection Application. PASS allows auditors to create, manage and initiate the creation of audit cases. PASS evaluates information in the Compliance Repository and identifies potential audit candidates. PASS uses models to define the criteria that should be used to evaluate the data in the Compliance Repository. As a sub-system of PASS, Return Reconstruction uses Federal and State data from the Compliance Repository to build a proposed audit return. Return Reconstruction contains the logic necessary to reconstruct a state return from the federal and state data sources. \n\nThe PASS application has a PowerBuilder-based front end interface that is installed on the desktop or laptop computer for data entry/model definition.  The backend PASS processes runs on a Unix server.  The batch processes that run on the Unix server are written in C\\+\\+ and Oracle stored procedures. Return Reconstruction jobs are processed via the Tivoli job scheduler in production. Return Reconstruction distributes the proposed audit return information to AR as an XML file through the return processing (RP) process. The Return Reconstruction application is stand-alone program written using Oracle packages, stored procedures and functions. The Return Reconstruction processes are launched via calls to Unix scripts that in turn invoke the Return Reconstruction Oracle packages. Source data for Return Reconstruction consists of Federal data (1040, CP2000, EOAD) and State data (760,763,760PY forms),\n\n*FileNet*\n\nFileNet is used by the Virginia Department of Taxation as the content repository of paper tax returns, taxpayer correspondence, and tax audit workpapers and contains both state and federal tax data. FileNet content can be accessed directly via FileNet Image Retrieval, but images from FileNet are most commonly accessed by selecting a link within the Advantage Revenue, Siebel or CACSG systems which accesses images using FileNet Image Viewer. The application is a commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) system supported by IBM.\n\nThe DataCap team performed an upgrade to the system to version P8 in 2017, with the help of CGI.  FileNet P8 provides a COTS web-based presentation layer, IBM Content Navigator (ICN), that replaces the agency-developed Image Retrieval and Image Viewer applications.  Image Retrieval uses an ICN stock search desktop.  Image Viewer uses a custom desktop developed in Java.  The agency has source code for this custom desktop and maintains it.  \n\nFileNet utilizes an Oracle database server to store image data.\n\n*SailPoint*\n\nThe SailPoint Identity IQ application system is an identity access management application that provides a means for users to request and when approved, receive access to various systems used by Virginia Tax employees. SailPoint provides compliance controls that help define and enforce user access policies, such as separation-of-duties (SOD) and automates the process of reviewing user acce", "sourcePath": "processedDocs/virginia-department-of-taxation-18025.md"}

ACF defined CCWIS requirements and outlined the need for a CCWIS that would ensure the safety and well-being of children and all families, strengthen, and preserve families to promote the healthy development of children, and focus on prevention, protection, or other short or long-term interventions to meet the needs of families. In December 2018, the Joint Legislative Audit Review Committee (JLARC) released the report “Improving Virginia’s Foster Care System” to the Virginia General Assembly. Many of the challenges identified in that JLARC report would be addressed and remedied once Virginia meets the requirements of the CCWIS final rule. *\n\n*A CCWIS is a child welfare information system that title IV-E agencies must develop to support their child welfare program needs. The CCWIS final rule does the following: (1) promotes data sharing with other agencies; (2) requires data quality plans; (3) reduces mandatory functional requirements; (4) allows agencies to build systems tailored to their needs; and (5) requires systems to be built modularly. *\n\n*Specific CCWIS requirements mandate that data be available to support the efficient, effective, and economical administration of the programs. Specific data reporting requirements include: *\n\n- *Data for ongoing federal child welfare reports. *\n- *Data to support implementation and monitoring of federal child welfare laws, regulations, and policies. *\n- *Case management data to support federal audits and reviews. *\n- *Data to support implementation and monitoring of state or tribal child welfare laws, regulations, policies, practices, reporting requirements, audits, program evaluations, and reviews; and, *\n- *Data for the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System.*\n\n*DFS is currently in the early stages of procurement to contract with a Design, Development, and Implementation (DDI) vendor for the new system, to begin work in the late summer or fall of 2024.  This Human Centered Design project will assist DFS with business process improvement, specifically testing how DFS’s current procedures and processes will work in an updated system.  The goal of this project is to conduct user experience research, present findings, and provide recommendations identifying areas where DFS procedures can inform DDI efforts for the new system while keeping customization to a minimum. VDSS expects the Supplier to incorporate feedback from users and community stakeholders while utilizing user experience research and tools, including but not limited to, journey maps and workflows.  Findings should be presented in a concise manner and supported by evidence drawn from research. Recommendations should be provided in an agile structure including themes, epics, features, and user stories aimed at ensuring excellent customer services to the families and community stakeholders within the Commonwealth.*\n\nBusiness Need\n\n*VDSS DFS promotes and supports the development of healthy families and protects Virginia's children and adults from abuse and neglect. Our objectives are to:*\n\n- *Develop and manage the skills and professional development of workers, providers and other partners*\n- *Meet the needs of customers and comply with federal and state requirements*\n- *Administer grants and contracts according to funding source requirements and procedures*\n\n*To prepare the workforce for a modern child welfare information system, this project, VDSS DFS Human Centered Design (HCD) Consultant, will review and update established workflows, prepare journey maps for system users and for stakeholders in the community that they encounter, identify pain points in current processes, and provide a roadmap to improve current processes.  The deliverables listed will facilitate the building of a state-of-the-art child welfare information system that is built with the end user in mind. This project will follow human centered design principles including, but not limited to, understanding the end users and stakeholders, engaging with end users and stakeholders throughout the process, and testing/revising processes based on end user feedback. *\n\n*Virgi", "sourcePath": "processedDocs/virginia-dss-division-of-family-services-dfs-virginia-dss-divisi.md"}

VDSS achieves its mission— To design and deliver high-quality human services that help Virginians achieve safety, independence and overall well- being —by partnering with multiple internal and external organizations and stakeholders to provide vital services to Virginia’s citizens.\n\nVDSS is undergoing an enterprise transformation journey to improve the citizen experience, optimize the VDSS professional experience, maximize efficiencies for the workforce, and reduce the cost to serve the constituent population. This calls for managing business transformation at scale, establishing an enterprise platform with integrated data and services, and designing a comprehensive and intuitive customer journey for state workers, local workers, and public constituents. Desired outcomes include moving from lengthy, waterfall, and expensive deployments to a rapid, agile, and predictable enterprise approach using an intentional platform architecture and predictable costs to deliver “quick wins”, mature enterprise capabilities, and iteratively realize business value.  \n\nVDSS has secured funding for several large initiatives, and is in the process of planning, execution, and production support for the following large system implementation initiatives:\n\n- Virginia Enterprise Licensing Application (VELA)\n- SNAP Knowledge Base\n- CommonHelp \n- Child Support System Modernization (CSSM)\n- Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS)\n\nFor each of the new enterprise systems, the agency’s goal is to develop the internal capabilities to perform application operations and maintenance services and implement system enhancements without dependence on a third-party integrator. The VDSS lines of business, in coordination with IT Services, will drive the requirements, identify the needed changes & enhancements, and assess the risks/dependencies for all enterprise projects.  Each enterprise project will be implemented using an enterprise delivery methodology that will require the management of concurrent sprints, portfolio-level risks and dependencies, and coordinated support from VDSS stakeholders across all divisions. Each project will also require major procurement efforts to select system integrators that will assist in deploying functional capability in an accelerated manner. Once the systems are in production, internal VDSS staff will be required to operate and maintain the systems. Therefore, the project teams will require multiple technical team members to work closely with the contracted system integrators during the implementation projects to ensure there is an effective transition to the internal staff at the completion of each project. The VDSS lines of business will drive the enhancements and other changes after a system is in production. \n\nFrom an enterprise transformation perspective, VDSS has successfully established an IT investment council and has deployed initial LCAP applications to their production environment. To help drive progress and provide services to support continued project delivery and transformation, VDSS seeks to partner with a supplier that brings implementation experience to establish a transformation team that is focused on enterprise alignment and change management. Establishing portfolio-level processes and frameworks is a key first step for establishing an agency Transformation Office that will be run by agency staff in the future.  The use of an enterprise approach, applied at the Portfolio level, will provide for greater functional and data integration across all VDSS lines of business and will move the agency closer to the goal of creating an integrated social services ecosystem.\n\n<a id=\"OLE_LINK96\"></a>__10. Scope of Work:__\n\nThis Statement of Requirements (SOR) defines the Enterprise Transformation & Portfolio Management activities required by the Authorized User in support of Virginia Department of Social Services Enterprise Initiatives.  \n\nFollowing the enterprise readiness assessment that was conducted in 2022 to evaluate the organization’s capability to undertake four separate, concurrent major initiatives using the existing internal resources, coupled with external contracted system integrators, VDSS recognizes the need to create an enterprise transformation office to accelerate change and transformation to execute upcoming initiatives. \n\nVDSS seeks a Supplier to stand up the transformation team and execute the recommended foundational and tactical activities to close gaps, identify and recommend software tools (e.g. Microsoft Project, Atlassian Jira, Azure DevOps, Copado GitHub, etc), to support the software delivery process, and improve the likelihood of successful project outcomes. The Supplier will also provide recommendations on the implementation of cross-functional product teams consisting of a line of business, IT Services, Information Security, and contracted system integrators to facilitate the delivery of systems, and provide ongoing product support after a project is complete.  The Supplier will review the current Change Advisory Board (CAB) and make recommendations for the transition of the CAB to support more Agile deliveries.  A goal of this SOR is to also identify a transition plan and path to transition all of the functions of the Digital Transformation Office to VDSS staff after a period of 6 months.  This requires the Supplier to develop and deliver training, standard operating procedures, templates, and documented policies that can be used by VDSS staff to sustain and operate the Digital Transformation Office once the transition is complete.  As part of this transition effort, the Supplier will also provide recommendations on specific staffing and skills needed to sustain the Digital Transformation Office after transition to VDSS.\n\nThe Supplier will provide a transformation team that consists of a Portfolio Manager, Organizational Change Management (OCM) Lead, Agile Transformation Delivery subject matter experts and analysts, and a User Experience Director.  Additionally, the Digital Transformation Office will incorporate and provide oversight for the functions of the Salesforce Technical Program and the Testing Program.  Staff and support for these two functions will be provided by VDSS thru FTEs or separate consultants.\n\n\n\nPor", "sourcePath": "processedDocs/virginia-dss-it-services-virginia-department-of-social-services.md"}

Project Kickoff – Identify core team and executive steering committee, roles and responsibilities, meeting cadence, and reporting structure, and key milestones and dates. \n2. Current State Baseline – The Supplier will leverage existing artifacts, conduct interviews, evaluate current services, and perform market research to inform service requirements for the MSI Request for Proposal (RFP). The following stakeholders will be interviewed: Executive Leadership, Shared Services Program Management, Shared Services Customers, and Service Providers.\n3. Strategy Workshop – Facilitate a workshop to solicit inputs from VITA leadership and sourcing management to capture customer needs, service challenges, and future state desired outcomes.\n4. Analysis and Recommendations – Prepare a gap analysis of the current state and desired future state and explore how the business requirements can be met in a more efficient and effective service delivery model, including the disposition of the current MSI scope.\n5. Risk Register – Identify, document, and categorize risks and develop mitigation strategies. The risk register is intended to be maintained and updated throughout the sourcing program. \n6. Governance Readiness – Assess the current state of the VITA program governance model as it applies to the future state environment, including information gathering from VITA leadership, Service Providers, and customers. Analyze the organizational impact of the evolving MSI model on the VITA retained organization.

For further information on the SLCGP generally, see CISA and FEMA's websites:\n\n\t[State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program | CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/state-and-local-cybersecurity-grant-program) \n\n\t[State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program | FEMA.gov](https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/state-local-cybersecurity-grant-program)\n\nFor further information on Virginia’s participation in the SLCGP, see VITA’s website:\n\n\t[Federal Cybersecurity Grants | Virginia IT Agency](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/information-security/grant-programs/)\n\nThe [Virginia Cybersecurity Planning Committee](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/information-security/cyber-awareness/cybersecurity-programs/federal-cybersecurity-grants/virginia-cybersecurity-planning-committee/) has developed a [Virginia Cybersecurity Plan](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/commonwealth-security/pdf/meetings/2022-Virginia-Cybersecurity-Plan.pdf), which has been approved by the federal government and is a prerequisite for using SLCGP funding.  The Plan contains Virginia’s objectives for the program and also identifies a set of priority objectives.  \n\nYear one funding is already available to Virginia.  The intent is to prioritize localities conducting a needs / gap assessment against the program objectives.  \n\nThe intent of this SOR is to identify and vet suppliers who will perform a needs / gap assessment of specified locality’s environment resulting in an artifact (the Findings and Recommendations Report described below).  The produced artifact is expected to be utilized as a baseline for the locality and as a guide and precursor for determining what cyber security services will be implemented through the SLCGP as further funding uses are approved.  VITA reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result of this SOR and our expectation is that at least one hundred five (105) assessments will be completed by one or more suppliers. However this is an estimate, and the actual quantity of assessments awarded may be more or less than those shown. \n\nAuthorized User will determine the in-scope localities for assessments before executing any resulting SOW(s).  \n\nBusiness Need \n\nThis SOR requires:\n\n- an overall review of a specified locality’s current capabilities as compared to the goals and objectives described in the Virginia Cybersecurity Plan, \n- An assessment of the capability level of the organization in its current state and,\n- Development of recommended security artifacts to support operationalization of the Virginia Cybersecurity Plan.\n\n__10. Scope of Work:__\n\nThis Statement of Requirements (SOR) defines the Cybersecurity Plan Capability Assessment Support required by the Virginia IT Agency (VITA). This SOR requires an overall review of specified locality’s current approach for meeting the goals and objectives outlined in the Cybersecurity Plan, as well as development of recommended security artifacts to support operationalization of the Cybersecurity Plan. \n\nThe Supplier will review specified locality’s current state capability against the following capabilities using a standard list of topics provided by VITA: \n\n- Inventory and control of technology assets, software and data\n- Threat monitoring\n- Threat protection and prevention\n- Data recovery and continuity\n- Security assessment  \n\n\nIn order to complete the current state assessment, the Supplier will be expected to conduct interviews with the locality’s personnel, and request and review a locality’s existing documentation and policies that support the Virginia Cybersecurity Plan goals and objectives. Supplier is expected to use its security expertise to ask the right questions and follow-ups so as to ensure a useful review.  Supplier is *not* being engaged to conduct technical tests of security systems or measures.\n\nAfter this initial evaluation, the Supplier will generate a Findings and Recommendations Report using a standard template provided by VITA. The draft report is provided as an attachment to this SOR. The report will describe the current state and also recommend actions to improve the locality’s capabilities, such as initial development of missing governance artifacts (e.g., Security Management plan, updated policies, updated standards, controls frameworks, capabilities, charters, etc.) as prioritized by senior leadership for this initial phase of this effort.  Prioritizations should focus on greatest impact, while keeping in mind feasibility of near-term and program objectives, and may include but are not limited to:\n\n- Manage, monitor, and track information systems, applications, and user accounts;\n- Monitor, audit, and track network traffic and activity;\n- Enhance the preparation, response, and resiliency of information systems, applications, and user accounts;\n- Implement a process of continuous cybersecurity risk factors and threat mitigation. practices prioritized by degree of risk;\n- Adopt and use best practices and methodologies to enhance cybersecurity (references NIST);\n- Implement multi-factor authentication, implement enhanced logging, data encryption for data at rest and in transit, end use of unsupported/end of life software and hardware that are accessible from the Internet, prohibit use of known/fixed/default passwords and credentials, ensure the ability to reconstitute systems (backups), migration to the .gov internet domain;\n- Promote the delivery of safe, recognizable, and trustworthy online ser", "sourcePath": "processedDocs/vita-localities-various-virginia-information-technologies-agency.md"}
