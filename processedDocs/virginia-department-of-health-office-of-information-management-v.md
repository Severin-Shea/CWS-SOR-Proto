Project History

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role states have in responding to novel, emerging, and existing disease threats. Over the past two years, increased funding and attention to public health has necessitated the articulation of clear data modernization priorities. CDC’s Data Modernization Initiative (DMI) is at the heart of a national effort to create modern, integrated, and real-time public health data and surveillance that can protect us from any health threat. Launched in 2020, DMI is a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar effort to modernize core data and surveillance infrastructure across the federal and state public health landscape. Public health agencies across the nation are examining their ecosystems of applications and data to establish roadmaps to achieve the goals and objectives of DMI, which include integrating data silos, improving data quality for data reporting, management, and analytics, increasing operational efficiency and data science capabilities, and enhancing public trust.

Business Need

The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) is in the process of developing the plans necessary to support the CDC Data Modernization Initiative. VDH has requested support from Supplier to support the Data Modernization team in finalizing the planning documents and supporting stakeholder engagement and collaboration across the VDH organization to gain consensus and buy-in from stakeholders in the execution of the plan. Supplier will perform functions in the following four categories, each further described below: Project Management, DMI Plan Assessment, DMI Planning Updates, and DMI Executive Charter.

1. __Additional Terms and Conditions:__

The services to be provided are subject to the following additional provisions:

1. Effective July 1, 2020, the Code of Virginia requires contractors with the Commonwealth who spend significant time working with or in close proximity to state employees to complete sexual harassment training.  As a result of the new code, VITA and the Department of Human Resource Management (DHRM) are requiring that all contractors working through the CAI contract complete DHRM's "Preventing Sexual Harassment" training.  This training is available as either a short video or a written transcript on the DHRM website: [https://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/public-interest/contractor-sexual-harassment-training](https://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/public-interest/contractor-sexual-harassment-training). The selected Supplier must agree that any assigned resource will complete the training.
2. The selected Supplier must agree that any assigned resource will review and conform to the IT Contingent Labor Program (ITCL) Contractor Code of Conduct.  The Code of Conduct can be reviewed on VITA’s website at the following link:

[https://www.vita.virginia.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/supply-chain/pdf/Contingent-Worker-Code-of-Conduct.pdf](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/supply-chain/pdf/Contingent-Worker-Code-of-Conduct.pdf)

1. __Scheduled Work Hours:__

It is anticipated that the majority of this work can be accomplished at the Vendor’s location.  If some of the work necessary for this project should be done on-site at the Authorized User’s location, on-site tasks should be identified in the proposed project plan in the SOW.  Vendor staff needed to accomplish these tasks should be identified at the start of the project and will be issued ID and building access cards.  Work hours for on-site staff will be between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm (EST), Monday thru Friday (excluding state holidays).  Changes to work hours must have prior approval by the Authorized User.

1. __Facility and equipment to be provided by Authorized User:__

Authorized User has limited workspace, furniture, and equipment available and only on a temporary basis.  Permanent office space, furniture, and equipment are the responsibility of the Vendor.   For work to be conducted on-site, Authorized User will provide temporary desk space and access to a copier.  Only state-owned equipment may be connected to the agency’s LAN, therefore if the Vendor requires access to the agency network, it must be noted in the SOW (to include the number of staff requiring access, type of access, and reasons), and the Authorized User will provide the necessary equipment and/or access after the kickoff of the project.  Otherwise, Vendor must provide any equipment (e.g., cell phones, personal computers or laptops) required by the Team.  If the Authorized User is required to provide state-owned computer equipment to the Vendor’s staff it may be necessary to allow additional time for the equipment to be acquired.  Additionally, in order to use state-owned equipment the Vendor’s staff must follow the Commonwealth’s and Authorized User’s agency computer access policies and procedures. 

The Vendor is responsible for the return of any state-owned equipment at the completion of the project, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing with the authorized user.
