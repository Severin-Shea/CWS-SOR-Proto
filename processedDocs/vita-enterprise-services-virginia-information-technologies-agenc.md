Project History

To serve the needs of agency customers, VITA is preparing to offer Salesforce services to the COVA enterprise.  VITA does not have the current capacity in house to manage the Salesforce environment and has chosen to outsource the services to an outside vendor.

Business Need

VITA requires Enterprise Salesforce services in alignment with VITA’s Mission, “To deliver sustainable and effective results to our customers through innovative, efficient and secure services.”

The services must be designed to provide a flexible model to meet the needs of COVA agencies at their self-defined level of size or complexity. The services must also offer VITA a central administrative team that can provide management and support in a predictable manner.

The services are divided into the following logical categories:

- Enterprise Salesforce O&M Support and 
- Enterprise Salesforce Optional Services

The following are the key guiding principles for this Enterprise Salesforce Support:

- Secure
- Scaleable 
- Repeatable
- Provide agencies maximum flexibility without compromising VITA Security Standards and Practices

While an organization will have the ability to self-implement their solutions, VITA will retain Super Admin Access. This Access is designed to keep the enterprise secure and in alignment with the controls setup by the SPLM process.

Project Management and Organizational Structure

The Supplier will provide a Project Manager who will be responsible for directing the Supplier services.  The Supplier PM will report to the VITA Enterprise Services Manager.

1. __Scope of Work:__
