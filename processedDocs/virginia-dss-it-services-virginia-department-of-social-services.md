1. __Introduction:__

The Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS) is an agency that reports to the Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Resources. VDSS achieves its mission— To design and deliver high-quality human services that help Virginians achieve safety, independence and overall well- being —by partnering with multiple internal and external organizations and stakeholders to provide vital services to Virginia’s citizens.

VDSS is undergoing an enterprise transformation journey to improve the citizen experience, optimize the VDSS professional experience, maximize efficiencies for the workforce, and reduce the cost to serve the constituent population. This calls for managing business transformation at scale, establishing an enterprise platform with integrated data and services, and designing a comprehensive and intuitive customer journey for state workers, local workers, and public constituents. Desired outcomes include moving from lengthy, waterfall, and expensive deployments to a rapid, agile, and predictable enterprise approach using an intentional platform architecture and predictable costs to deliver “quick wins”, mature enterprise capabilities, and iteratively realize business value.  

VDSS has secured funding for several large initiatives, and is in the process of planning, execution, and production support for the following large system implementation initiatives:

- Virginia Enterprise Licensing Application (VELA)
- SNAP Knowledge Base
- CommonHelp 
- Child Support System Modernization (CSSM)
- Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS)

For each of the new enterprise systems, the agency’s goal is to develop the internal capabilities to perform application operations and maintenance services and implement system enhancements without dependence on a third-party integrator. The VDSS lines of business, in coordination with IT Services, will drive the requirements, identify the needed changes & enhancements, and assess the risks/dependencies for all enterprise projects.  Each enterprise project will be implemented using an enterprise delivery methodology that will require the management of concurrent sprints, portfolio-level risks and dependencies, and coordinated support from VDSS stakeholders across all divisions. Each project will also require major procurement efforts to select system integrators that will assist in deploying functional capability in an accelerated manner. Once the systems are in production, internal VDSS staff will be required to operate and maintain the systems. Therefore, the project teams will require multiple technical team members to work closely with the contracted system integrators during the implementation projects to ensure there is an effective transition to the internal staff at the completion of each project. The VDSS lines of business will drive the enhancements and other changes after a system is in production. 

From an enterprise transformation perspective, VDSS has successfully established an IT investment council and has deployed initial LCAP applications to their production environment. To help drive progress and provide services to support continued project delivery and transformation, VDSS seeks to partner with a supplier that brings implementation experience to establish a transformation team that is focused on enterprise alignment and change management. Establishing portfolio-level processes and frameworks is a key first step for establishing an agency Transformation Office that will be run by agency staff in the future.  The use of an enterprise approach, applied at the Portfolio level, will provide for greater functional and data integration across all VDSS lines of business and will move the agency closer to the goal of creating an integrated social services ecosystem.

<a id="OLE_LINK96"></a>__10. Scope of Work:__

This Statement of Requirements (SOR) defines the Enterprise Transformation & Portfolio Management activities required by the Authorized User in support of Virginia Department of Social Services Enterprise Initiatives.  

Following the enterprise readiness assessment that was conducted in 2022 to evaluate the organization’s capability to undertake four separate, concurrent major initiatives using the existing internal resources, coupled with external contracted system integrators, VDSS recognizes the need to create an enterprise transformation office to accelerate change and transformation to execute upcoming initiatives. 

VDSS seeks a Supplier to stand up the transformation team and execute the recommended foundational and tactical activities to close gaps, identify and recommend software tools (e.g. Microsoft Project, Atlassian Jira, Azure DevOps, Copado GitHub, etc), to support the software delivery process, and improve the likelihood of successful project outcomes. The Supplier will also provide recommendations on the implementation of cross-functional product teams consisting of a line of business, IT Services, Information Security, and contracted system integrators to facilitate the delivery of systems, and provide ongoing product support after a project is complete.  The Supplier will review the current Change Advisory Board (CAB) and make recommendations for the transition of the CAB to support more Agile deliveries.  A goal of this SOR is to also identify a transition plan and path to transition all of the functions of the Digital Transformation Office to VDSS staff after a period of 6 months.  This requires the Supplier to develop and deliver training, standard operating procedures, templates, and documented policies that can be used by VDSS staff to sustain and operate the Digital Transformation Office once the transition is complete.  As part of this transition effort, the Supplier will also provide recommendations on specific staffing and skills needed to sustain the Digital Transformation Office after transition to VDSS.

The Supplier will provide a transformation team that consists of a Portfolio Manager, Organizational Change Management (OCM) Lead, Agile Transformation Delivery subject matter experts and analysts, and a User Experience Director.  Additionally, the Digital Transformation Office will incorporate and provide oversight for the functions of the Salesforce Technical Program and the Testing Program.  Staff and support for these two functions will be provided by VDSS thru FTEs or separate consultants.



Portfolio Management: The Supplier will provide support to review current practices and facilitate project portfolio management best practices. This includes recommendations on software tools to capture and manage the portfolio of agency projects and all associated agency resources (staff and budget).  The Supplier will also coordinate across all business areas to rebaseline current enterprise initiatives and timelines.

Organizational Change Management: The Organizational Change Management Lead will play a key role in ensuring business transformation program objectives are realized on time and on budget by increasing employee adoption and usage. This person will focus on the people side of change, including changes to business processes, systems and technology, job roles and organization structures. The primary responsibility will be creating and implementing change management strategies and plans that maximize employee adoption and usage and minimize resistance. The change manager will work to drive faster adoption, higher ultimate utilization of and proficiency with the changes that impact all employees.

Agile Transformation: The Agile Transformation Lead will quickly establish collaborative partnership with key stakeholders to ensure leadership buy-in across both Business and IT. The Supplier will become a strategic partner in organizational roadmapping and structuring to drive increased adoption and higher transformation success. The Lead will provide agile coaching and training at all levels in an emerging Agile environment.  The Lead will also assess the current organization and delivery environment and recommend optimal Agile practices tailored to VDSS.  The Lead will identify and execute best practices to increase delivery, transparency and quality, and will coordinate with individual enterprise project ScrumMasters to facilitate sprint roadmapping, planning sessions and retrospectives across all enterprise projects. The Lead will support the triage and resolution of critical impediments, and will prepare and deliver effective communications both verbally and orally regarding progress and status for both internal and client teams.

User Experience: The User Experience Director will be responsible for keeping track of customer journeys, interacting with customers across channels and platforms, and coordinating with all internal VDSS stakeholders in order to keep fine-tuning the customer’s experience across VDSS lines of business. The Director will  facilitate the creation of customer journey maps, which are visual storylines of every engagement a customer has with VDSS lines of business. The creation of journey maps puts VDSS directly in the mind of the end customer, so they can see and understand the customer’s processes, needs, and perceptions.

Testing Program:  The Supplier will coordinate with the VDSS Testing Manager who is responsible for the enterprise testing program, which entails the development of a testing framework (test plans templates, test report templates, test acceptance criteria standards, test case development, etc) to be used by all enterprise projects

Salesforce Technical Program.  The Supplier will coordinate with the VDSS Salesforce Technical Program team responsible for administering the Salesforce technical environment, operating the VDSS continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, and enforcing environment standards and practices across all environments (System Integration Test, QA Test, User Acceptance Test, Pre-Production, etc)
