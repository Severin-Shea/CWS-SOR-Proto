Project History

The objective of this project is to develop and articulate a vision for the effective use of technology to support the work of the City of Fredericksburg. The City is focused on the proposed IT Strategic Plan as the cornerstone of our efforts to improve the balance between demand for more and better technology, innovation, and security, and available IT resources, capital, and operating funds.

The City’s last IT Strategic Plan was completed in 2015.  The City is primarily motivated to develop an IT Strategic Plan to continue to provide appropriate support, security, and resiliency in an evolving IT landscape and in consideration of expanding end points in the City.  

This work is planned for FY23-FY24 to help address the growing number of devices, data, systems and IT Help Calls and the plan is expected to provide a roadmap for the FY25 budget and beyond.

Business Need

The IT Strategic Plan should inform many important decisions in the City such as when and what to move to the cloud, industry best practices to secure cloud and on premise systems, data governance, how to best prepare for and respond to supply chain vulnerabilities and cyber supply chain risk management, and how to streamline and monitor disparate systems to best apply security and provide support in the future.  An analysis of IT’s customer business needs is central to this work.

Project Complexity

Data collection from approximately 650  IT users (survey tool potential), technical expertise on cyber security, cloud systems, and emerging technology trends as well as any implementation challenges, project is fixed cost.

Project Management and Organizational Structure

Project Manager: Chief Information Officer
