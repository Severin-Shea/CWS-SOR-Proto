1. __Introduction:__

Project History: As an agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation \(DRPT\) is required to follow COV ITRM Standard SEC501\-11\.4 \(SEC501\)\. DRPT has three \(3\) interactive web applications and six \(6\) public\-facing websites that are required to undergo penetration tests as mandated by control CA\-8 of SEC501\.

Project Complexity:  This project is medium complexity and low risk\.

Business Need:  DRPT is committed to complying with SEC501 and as such, penetration testing of the above\-referenced applications is required\. In addition to complying with SEC501, DRPT is committed to ensuring the ongoing security posture of these web applications\. Therefore, the Supplier shall perform penetration tests of these applications on a monthly basis for twelve \(12\) contiguous months\.

Project Management and Organizational Structure

DRPT’s Information Technology Manager and/or designee\(s\) will be the leads for this effort\. The Supplier will provide deliverables to the Information Technology Manager\. 

1. __Scope of Work:__

This SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service\.  

In connection with the Services, the Supplier will perform the following tasks:

- Conduct a baseline penetration test of the following web applications:
	- Online Grant Administration \(OLGA\)
	- Financial and Procurement System \(Bobcat\)
	- DRPT Intranet
	- DRPT public website
	- Telework\!VA website
	- CommuteVA website
	- VanpoolVA website
	- BikeToWorkVA website
	- TransitVA website

Prior to testing, the Supplier shall work with DRPT to develop written Rules of Engagement to confirm the scope of the testing, including specific Uniform Resource Locators \(URLs\), the type of attacks that may be out of scope \(e\.g\., intentional denial of service\), assumptions and limitations, authorized test windows, and points of contact during the testing\.

The Supplier shall deliver a baseline report that covers each of the above\-referenced web applications\. The report shall include:

- 
	- Overview of activities performed and testing methodology
	- Summary of findings
	- Detailed findings narrative
	- Suggested remediations for findings and/or enhancements to improve the security posture of the web application

The Supplier shall provide a briefing of the findings to the DRPT IT Manager and others as determined by DRPT leadership\.

- Conduct monthly testing of the above\-referenced applications to determine whether newly exploitable vulnerabilities were introduced in the intervals between tests\. DRPT may, at its discretion, request that the monthly test for an application be conducted prior to release of an enhancement to one of the web applications referenced above\.

The Supplier shall report out the results to DRPT after each test in a written summary and briefing\.
