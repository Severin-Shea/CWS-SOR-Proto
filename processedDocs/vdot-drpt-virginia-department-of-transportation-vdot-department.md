Project History

The purpose of this project is to enhance the existing web-based application tool that was created as part of a legislatively required project prioritization process.  Enhancements to the tool will allow applications to be submitted for multiple prioritizations-based grant programs to include State of Good Repair (SGR), Systemic Safety Improvements (SSI), Transportation Alternatives (TA), Revenue Sharing (RS), Highway Safety (HSIP), Bike/Ped Safety (BPSP), High Priority and District grant funding programs, supporting three VDOT divisions and three agencies under the Secretary of Transportation.

The Business has a partially automated process to receive, validate, and score eligible applications for SMART SCALE, Transportation Alternatives, Revenue Sharing, Highway Safety, Bike/Ped Safety, State of Good Repair, and Pre-Scoping applications and they need to enhance and improve the current process to facilitate the intake, screening, validation and scoring of the constantly increasing number of submissions of new applications. Additionally, the business needs to provide a web-based application tool to guide and help applicants to submit complete applications that are eligible for funding.  

The current web-based application tool needs to be improved to allow for authorized applicants not only to submit eligible applications, but also re-submit applications not funded in prior cycles. The business needs to provide a system for localities/districts/jurisdictions to submit their Transportation projects that is simple and easy to use by all stakeholders. The tool must make it easier for the state to validate, screen, and score all applications without having to hire additional staff to complete the process within the required short timeframes.*  *

Business Need

The updated version of the web-based application tool must meet the following criteria:

 

- User must be able to submit application without having to hire a consulting company to help develop the proposed project
- Allow for all applications not selected for the Six-year Improvement Plan (SYIP) to be activated - System will present list and reload data of projects that can be resubmitted
- Maintain previously submitted data - All data previously entered will be available for resubmission
- Allow for Add/Edit/Delete data of existing applications - All data loaded
- Allow applicants to submit for multiple grant programs through a single web-based portal.
-  Improve Application Data Architecture
- Administrative Toolset – Provide Tools to better manage the SMART Portal system, users, and organizations through user interface controls
- Allow for scoring integration for all existing programs

 

The updated version of the tool will support applications submitted for multiple grant programs to include SMART SCALE, State of Good Repair, Systemic Safety Improvements, Transportation Alternatives, Revenue Sharing, Safety, Rail, Bike/Ped, High Priority and District grant funding programs, supporting three VDOT divisions and three agencies under the Secretary of Transportation.
