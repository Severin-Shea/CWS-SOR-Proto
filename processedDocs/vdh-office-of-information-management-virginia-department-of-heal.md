1. __Contract Type:__ Fixed Price, Deliverable\-based
2. __Introduction:__

VDH previously released a service requisition for this project based on the Salesforce platform in October 2022\.  VDH received many questions during Vendor Q&A; as some of these questions are still pertinent to the scope of this SOR, that Q&A document has been included as a reference attachment \(*VDH\_SOR\_Agency Grant Management System Vendor Q&A \- Original SOR VDH\-221025\-01\-CAI\.docx*\)\. 

Project History

The agency is currently using Microsoft Office Excel and Word to document and manage grant activity\. These tools do not have the capabilities to support necessary improvements to communications, processes, analysis or the reporting required to serve the Commonwealth at a higher level\.

Business Need

It is imperative that the agency has the right application to manage grant activities to support accurate analysis, timely reporting and decision making\. Agency teams have established processes and tools; however, after a current state assessment, many opportunities to improve operational efficiency were identified\. As a result of these efforts, the program is looking to modernize and implement an application that allows standardization across the various groups, supports required integrations to financial systems and provides a central data repository that allows for integrated document management for 30 plus users \(this may increase\) with the following roles: Grant Administrators, Accountants, Procurement/General Services Specialists, and Agency Grant Specialists\.

Project Complexity

Because of the agency team’s operational maturity level, the number of groups represented, the allocated budget and the required system integrations, this project is estimated to be high complexity and low risk\. Vendors will be tasked with reviewing and analyzing agency provided requirements and assisting with their refinement to ultimately design and implement an approved solution\.

Project Management and Organizational Structure

To ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the defined scope; VDH’s Office of Information Management will assign a Project Manager and a Business Analyst/Technical Lead to coordinate activities and ensure all work is performed and meets the agency’s expectations\. In addition, an Information Security Officer will be assigned to the project to ensure the security standards of the Commonwealth of Virginia are upheld\.  VDH Business Owners and Subject Matter Experts will be responsible for overall validation of the project\. A Virginia Information Technologies Agency \(VITA\) Project Management Division \(PMD\) representative will be assigned and responsible for project oversight and governance\. Vendors will provide a dedicated project manager who will be required to develop a proposed schedule, attend scheduled meetings and submit regular status reports\. Vendors will submit all work to designated VDH agency staff responsible for project oversight, technical development, and business approval\.  VDH technical and business staff will be available to support the Vendors’ project team to address issues and concerns\.

- Weekly Status Meetings:  These meetings will be used as an opportunity for the project team, key stakeholders and the vendors to review current statuses, risks and issues, and the project schedule\. 
- Stand\-Ups: At a minimum frequency of twice a week, delivery team members will spend a total of 15 minutes reporting to each other and identifying needs\. Each team member summarizes what they did in previous days, what they are currently working on, and what challenges they face if any\. The project managers will be responsible for addressing any challenges and escalating the challenges when necessary\.
- Inter\-Agency Oversight Committee \(IAOC\) Meetings: To ensure delivery governance and stewardship, an oversight committee made up of VDH Executive Leadership \(Deputy Commissioner of Administration, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Information Officer\), a VITA PMD representative, the VDH Project Manager and Vendor Project Managers/Delivery Lead\. This committee will be responsible for hearing progress reports, reviewing identified risks & issues, removing blockers & impediments, and address any other business\. They will also be responsible for approving any proposed changes to the scope, schedule and or budget\. This meeting will be scheduled by the VDH Project Manager and held monthly\.

1. __Scope of Work:__

This SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service\. The scope of this project is to implement a modern grant management application solution that can be maintained by VDH without additional vendor support and includes:

- Project Management
- Requirement analysis and refinement 
- Application Design
- Application Development and/or configuration
- Application Integrations with 3rd party systems

1. __Additional Terms and Conditions:__

The services to be provided are subject to the following additional provisions:

1. Effective July 1, 2020, the Code of Virginia requires contractors with the Commonwealth who spend significant time working with or in close proximity to state employees to complete sexual harassment training\.  As a result of the new code, VITA and the Department of Human Resource Management \(DHRM\) are requiring that all contractors working through the CAI contract complete DHRM's "Preventing Sexual Harassment" training\.  This training is available as either a short video or a written transcript on the DHRM website: [https://www\.dhrm\.virginia\.gov/public\-interest/contractor\-sexual\-harassment\-training](https://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/public-interest/contractor-sexual-harassment-training)\. The selected Supplier must agree that any assigned resource will complete the training\.
2. The selected Supplier must agree that any assigned resource will review and conform to the IT Contingent Labor Program \(ITCL\) Contractor Code of Conduct\. The Code of Conduct can be reviewed on VITA’s website at the following link:

[https://www\.vita\.virginia\.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/supply\-chain/pdf/Contingent\-Worker\-Code\-of\-Conduct\.pdf](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/supply-chain/pdf/Contingent-Worker-Code-of-Conduct.pdf)

1. __Scheduled Work Hours:__

It is anticipated that the majority of this work can be accomplished at the Vendor’s location\.  If some of the work necessary for this project should be done on\-site at the Authorized User’s location, on\-site tasks should be identified in the proposed project plan in the SOW\.  Vendor staff needed to accomplish these tasks should be identified at the start of the project and will be issued ID and building access cards\.  Work hours for on\-site staff will be between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm \(EST\), Monday thru Friday \(excluding state holidays\)\.  Changes to work hours must have prior approval by the Authorized User\.

1. __Facility and equipment to be provided by Authorized User:__

Authorized User has limited workspace, furniture, and equipment available and only on a temporary basis\.  Permanent office space, furniture, and equipment are the responsibility of the Vendor\.   For work to be conducted on\-site, Authorized User will provide temporary desk space and access to a copier\.  Only state\-owned equipment may be connected to the agency’s LAN, therefore if the Vendor requires access to the agency network, it must be noted in the SOW \(to include the number of staff requiring access, type of access, and reasons\), and the Authorized User will provide the necessary equipment and/or access after the kickoff of the project\.  Otherwise, Vendor must provide any equipment \(e\.g\., cell phones, personal computers or laptops\) required by the Team\.  If the Authorized User is required to provide state\-owned computer equipment to the Vendor’s staff it may be necessary to allow additional time for the equipment to be acquired\.  Additionally, in order to use state\-owned equipment the Vendor’s staff must follow the Commonwealth’s and Authorized User’s agency computer access policies and procedures\. 

The Vendor is responsible for the return of any state\-owned equipment at the completion of the project, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing with the authorized user\.
