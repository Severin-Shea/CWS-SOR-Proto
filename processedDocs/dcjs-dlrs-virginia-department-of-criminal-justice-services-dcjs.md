1. __Introduction:__

Project History

DCJS plans and executes criminal justice programs and aid initiatives that are designed to improve the functioning and effectiveness of the criminal justice system. To fulfill this mission, DCJS:

The agency’s primary constituents are local and state criminal justice agencies and practitioners, private security practitioners and businesses, and the public-at-large. Other constituents include local governments and state agencies, the federal government and advocacy groups/associations.

The Division of Licensure and Regulatory Services (DLRS) involves the oversight and enforcement of five statutory and regulatory programs.  DLRS is dedicated to providing excellent customer service to its constituents and professionals serving the private side of public safety.  The statutory and regulatory programs are as follows:  

- Private Security Services
	- Security Officers (Armed and Unarmed)
	- Private Investigators
	- Armored Car Personnel
	- Electronic Security Technicians
	- Electronic Sales Representatives
	- Central Station Dispatchers
	- Personal Protection Specialists (Bodyguards)
	- Locksmiths
	- Businesses
	- Training Schools
	- Compliance Agents
	- Instructors
- Bail Bondsmen (Surety and Property)
- Bail Enforcement Agents (Bounty Hunters)
- Special Conservator of the Peace
- Tow Truck Drivers

DLRS currently has a credential management system which was implemented in 2015.  It offers a back-office application that staff uses to manage applications, an online portal that customers use to submit applications, an online portal that training schools use to submit class rosters, it interfaces with a third party online portal that individuals/businesses use to pay required fees, and interfaces to Fieldprint and the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for photo IDs, fingerprints, and accessing DMV driving records.

Business Need 

DCJS has started the process for replacing their existing custom credential management system with a packaged solution. Ahead of the project, DCJS seeks to assess their current business processes and look for opportunities to make them more efficient and streamlined.

Project Complexity

This project is of moderate complexity and risk due to the following factors:

1. Project requirements and business rule documentation for the system replacement have been completed as part of the RFP for the new credential management system. 
2. Current business process inventory does not exist. As part of this engagement, process inventory and high-priority processes must be identified to define the scope for this engagement.
3. The risk is not updating the processes to a “future” state because staff/selected supplier engagement is low, and the potential challenges related to coordinating desk level interviews due to remote work and reliance on Microsoft Teams. This could result in poorly designed target-state processes for the next project (system replacement) and, ultimately, an inefficient system upgrade.  However, the Division believes that they can mitigate the risk related to remote work while conducting the project.

Project Management and Organizational Structure

The agency IT team is comprised of a Chief Technology Officer, an Information Security Officer, two Project Managers, two System Administrators, two Help Desk Technicians, five Developers, and a DBA.  The project will require input from the Division of Licensure and Regulatory Services, which is depicted in the agency organizational chart below.
