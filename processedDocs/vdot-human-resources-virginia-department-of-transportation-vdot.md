1. __Introduction:__

__Project History__

The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has over the years built individual custom Human Resource (HR) systems to meet the growing needs of the Agency.  VDOT recognized the need to replace these outdated HR systems with an integrated Cloud Human Capital Management (HCM) solution to enable VDOT growth and to support Agency initiatives.  

VDOT has selected Oracle HCM Cloud Services as our HCM solution. This solution is a comprehensive, modernized, and user friendly Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system that automates all of VDOT’s desired HR functions and provides the best value based on business needs versus product capabilities and cost. 

VDOT is currently in the process of procuring the following:

__Business Need__

VDOT has custom built most of its HR systems that support HR activities for the entire Agency.  The current HR Works\! platform* *is currently built on unsupported or soon to be unsupported technologies including SharePoint 2010 and K2 4.69. It is implemented with custom code that not only results in operational complexity but in difficulties implementing future business changes, additional functionality and updates. 

VDOT seeks to replace the HR Works\! platform and other standalone HR applications with the Oracle HCM Cloud Services, as it is expensive to sustain currently and would require significant ongoing investment to move and maintain in the Cloud.  

Oracle HCM Cloud Services will benefit all VDOT employees and management by unifying and simplifying many HR services in the following areas: Talent Acquisition & Onboarding; Compensation, Performance Management, Personnel Files and Core HR and Administrative functions.  The solution will be used across the agency by all staff responsible for this business function as well as all VDOT employees and potential candidates.  Current VDOT HR processes in HR Works\! are manual and with this solution, will be automated and encourage increased employee self-service (ESS).  

This effort will support the COVA Strategic Plan goal to manage and direct the evaluation and adoption of cloud computing to address agency business requirements for a secure, flexible, economical, and rapidly scalable computing environment. In addition, this effort supports the Governor’s priorities to encourage innovation and research, and to make our government accessible and efficiently managed.

__Project Complexity and Risk__

This project is considered high risk with high complexity, due to the sensitivity and criticality of the employee data captured and the integration points across multiple data sources and destination within the current HR environment and ecosystem.  During the project, Supplier will provide regular communications to Authorized User regarding the risks to ensure any increased risks are quickly identified and reviewed.  

__Project Management and Organizational Structure__

The HCM Cloud Implementation project is managed as a Commonwealth of Virginia major IT project.  The project is managed through the VDOT Information Technology Division (ITD), with input from the Human Resources Division Administrator as the business owner.  A Steering Committee will be established to monitor and govern the implementation of this project.



1. __Scope:__

This SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  

__PLEASE NOTE:  This SOR includes the scope for the full implementation of the Oracle HCM solution.  Phases 1 and 2 of the project are currently being delivered under a previous SOW that was executed.  This SOR is being reissued to solicit the SOW for Phase 3 only.  The Phase 3 scope will be narrowly defined in the new SOW.__

1. __In Scope:__

- Supplier will provide pre-defined standard business processes for the Oracle HCM Cloud Services based on their best practice methodology that has been utilized to provide clients with the context, understanding and expertise to successfully meet their HR objectives.
- Authorized User will leverage the out-of-the-box functionality from Oracle HCM Cloud services to the greatest extent possible in order to limit extensive configuration.

1. __Overview__

The Enterprise Architecture Supplemental Statement Requirements (EA-SSOR) is a supplement to the Statement of Requirements (SOR) for supplier delivered software solutions procured by VDOT’s Information Technology Division (ITD).  In addition to this EA-SSOR, a zipped folder is attached to the SOR containing Artifact Templates, Examples, & Guidance that are referenced throughout this document. 

Except for this Supplement, the SOR Agreement remains unchanged. The validity of all terms and conditions not expressly amended by this Supplement remain unaffected. This Supplement constitutes an integral part of the Agreement, sets forth, together with the Agreement, the entire agreement between the Parties and this Supplement supersedes any conflicts between the documents.

1. __Enterprise Architecture Requirements - Guiding Principles__

__2.1 Compliance __

VDOT is governed by Commonwealth of Virginia (COV) Policy and Standards and administered by the Virginia Information Technology Agency (VITA).   Documents below can be found on the VITA site > [https://www.vita.virginia.gov/it-governance/itrm-policies-standards/](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/it-governance/itrm-policies-standards/)

The supplier shall implement a solution that shall comply with:

2.1.1 VITA Information Security Policy SEC519-00

2.1.2 VITA Information Security Standard SEC501

2.1.3 VITA Information Technology Security Audit Standard SEC502-03

2.1.4 COV ITRM Security Policy SEC501-06

2.1.5 Hosted Environment Information Security Standard SEC525 for XaaS Solutions only.  

2.1.6 VITA Enterprise Architecture Policies

	2.1.6.1 EA-Standard 225-01

	2.1.6.2 EA-Standard 225-06

2.1.7 The communication needs of customers with disabilities, as defined by VITA Accessibility Standard GOV103-00. The IT Accessibility Topic Report (GOV103-02) is aligned with the U.S. Access Board’s revised section 508 (accessibility) and includes section 255 (telecommunications) pursuant to the Code of Virginia, § 2.2-2012.

2.1.8 VITA IT Risk Management Standard SEC520-02

2.1.9 Applicable provisions for the Oracle HCM Cloud service as stipulated in the Oracle reseller agreement VA-170130 with VITA, and any of its modifications

__2.2 Enterprise Architecture Patterns __

This section is not applicable as it is a SaaS product implementation.

__2.3 Platforms and Products __

The supplier is authorized to utilize products identified in the SOR for this solution.   For other components, the supplier must work within the Enterprise Architecture Repository Management System (EARMS) published catalog of approved and up to date technologies; or submit an Exception Request under the guidance of the assigned VDOT Architect when an adequate technology is not available in the catalog.  Examples of additional products that maybe needed are document storage, business intelligence, reporting, 3rd party supplemental products, etc. The supplier can inquire with Authorized User if technologies they propose to be part of the solution are currently included.

__2.4 Identity and Access Management__

2.4.1 The solution shall implement security based on knowledge of and transparency around the individual actor. VDOT is using Active Directory Federated Services tied to the Commonwealth of Virginia user domain (aka COVFS) as its enterprise identity provider. OKTA is the preferred method for the identity gateway.

__2.5 Duplication of Data__

VDOT data is often voluminous and requires quality assurance in support of public safety.

2.5.1 The supplier shall leverage data from the source only, rather than copying the data.   

2.5.2 If the solution demands a copy of data from a Source System of Record, the supplier shall submit an Exception Request under the guidance of the assigned VDOT Architect.

__2.6 Encryption__

Data *At Rest* and* In Flight *shall be encrypted*.   *

__2.7 Enterprise and Master Data Patterns __

VDOT requires the use of master data when sharing data with other systems. Master data originates and is maintained in the source system of record and should be consumed from the master data repository.  This avoids making point-to-point connections between various applications.  Data should never be changed or updated outside of its originating system. 

2.7.1     The supplier, with the assistance of the assigned VDOT Architect, shall review data sourced from this solution and required by other solutions for identification as Enterprise or Master Data and follow pattern standards.

2.7.2 The supplier shall submit an Exception Request, under the guidance of the assigned VDOT Architect, when they cannot comply with pattern definitions.

__2.8 Point-to-Point Integrations Require an Exception Request__

2.8.1 The supplier shall avoid all point-to-point integrations. Suppliers shall coordinate with the assigned architect for clarification on their proposed solution.

2.8.2 The supplier shall submit a Exception Request under the guidance of the assigned VDOT Architect before opting to utilize a point-to-point integration. Within the Exception Request the supplier shall describe each of the following:  

1. The proposed point-to-point integration.
2. The business and/or technical reason(s) justifying the point-to-point integration.
3. All compliant alternatives explored and why they cannot be used.
4. All application components impacted by this proposed integration.
