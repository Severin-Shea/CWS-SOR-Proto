1. __Introduction:__

Project History

The SCC is vested with regulatory authority over many business and economic interests in Virginia. It is organized as a separate department of government with delegated administrative, legislative, and judicial powers. SCC regulatory decisions can only be appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court. 

The State Corporation Commission’s Division of Securities and Retail Franchising (“Division”)  regulates the offer and sale of securities, investment advice and franchises, and facilitates the registration of securities and trademarks and service marks.

The Division is responsible for administering the Securities Act, the Retail Franchising Act, and the Trademark and Service Mark Act.  In administering these Acts, the overall mission of the Division is to protect the public by promoting a fair and stable marketplace of investment products and services through education, compliance and enforcement, while enhancing economic growth.

The Division’s staffing has remained relatively stable for many years and currently has 43 edicated, knowledgeable employees. The Division is led by a director with 50\+ years of experience supported by 4 sections: Registration, Examinations, Audit and Investigations.  Excluding the Director, staff experience level is over 13 years. Three new employees were hired in the last year with more expected as retirements increase. As such, transfer of knowledge and streamlined documented processes are key strategies to ensure continuity of operations. 

The Division has adapted well to recent organizational changes including a new Deputy Director, addition of 3 new Principals (front line supervisors and Subject matter experts); and consolidation of 2 sections, Enforcement and Investigations, into one. Staff engagement is high and open to process improvements prior to another strategic priority, modernizing our division system.

Business Need

The Division has decided to modernize its work processes in order to gain efficiencies, enhance performance, and lay the foundation for managed business processes. The Division has decided to undertake this effort in part due to the desire to align with SCC’s goal of instituting repeatable and predictable business processes to enable high performance, as well as to prepare for the upcoming upgrade of the Divisions’ workflow system, SERFIS.  It is in this context that the SCC now seeks outside support to assist in achieving this future state. 

 

The SCC requires an analysis of the processes related to the Division to identify opportunities for improved performance and productivity. 

 

The intent of this engagement is to create the Deliverables detailed below. The execution of resulting Deliverables is not in scope. The SCC may, in its sole discretion, issue a subsequent Statement of Requirements for services related to the execution of resulting Deliverables. 

 

Tables I and II below include the SCC’s assessment of necessary Deliverables and Deliverables Examples, as applicable.  However, the SCC will consider alternative or additional Deliverables (and associated timelines as applicable) as proposed and specifically described by Suppliers.  

Project Complexity

The project complexity is medium, as is the risk.  The division has process documentation as it relates to our current, old system (SERFIS) though it may not be entirely up to date. The risk is not updating the processes to a “to be” state because staff/vendor engagement is low, the time and coordination of desk level interviews due to remote work and reliance on Microsoft teams. This could result poorly designed systems requirements and an inefficient system upgrade. 

Project Management and Organizational Structure

Outlined in 13 B. The divisions Deputy director will serve as executive sponsor and our Systems Supervisor will have the business lead role. The expectation will be to have weekly check point meetings via MT if not in person, to ensure the timelines are being met and there is open communication from both Division and Vendor perspective.
