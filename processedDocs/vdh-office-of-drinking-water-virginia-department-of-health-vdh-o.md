Project History

The Virginia [Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF) program](https://www.epa.gov/dwsrf) provides technical and financial assistance to waterworks through a balanced approach of using set-asides and construction project funds. Currently, DWSRF data is tracked within siloed systems and tools including: a system over 14 years old and manually tracked in spreadsheets and other documents resulting in timely processes and reporting challenges. To facilitate administration of the program and support the public health, the Virginia DWSRF program completed an effort to identify business and technology opportunities that will improve operational efficiency, allow more accurate reporting and analysis, facilitate planning and support better decision making.

As a result of these efforts, the program is looking to modernize and implement a system that allows standardization across the various groups withing the DWSRF program, provides a central data repository while ensuring data quality, allows for integrated document management and facilitates reporting and decision making. 

Business Need

The Virginia DWSRF program supports the public health and quality of life for all citizens of the Commonwealth. It is imperative that the program has the right tools to manage funded projects, and availability to complete accurate and timely data for reporting and decision making.

The program has established processes and tools; however, operational gaps were identified as part of the assessment efforts and recommendations provided to help the program mature and achieve more operational efficiency including the standardization of tools, processes and project management methodology across regions and teams within the program.

The DWSRF Program is seeking a vendor partner to help:

- Analyze six (6) current state processes within the program to provide process improvement recommendations and define a future state that allows for efficiency and standardization across regions and teams.
- Establish a project governance framework across the program. This includes standardize templates, tools, and new processes across regions. Also define a document structure to help consolidate a portal for PMO tools, documentation, and training material 

Project Complexity

This project is estimated to be medium complexity and low risk.  The Supplier will be tasked with gathering and documenting high level requirements, analyzing current state, designing future state and implementing changes that support the Virginia DWSRF program’s long-term vision and goals.

Project Management and Organizational Structure

The supplier is required to provide dedicated project management, including creation and management of the Project Schedule.  Section 21 outlines the requirements for project metrics (risks, issues, action items, etc.) to be tracked and included in the status reports.  All project meetings will have notes taken and communicated to the project team. Action items should be verbally identified at the project meeting and included (or referenced, if tracked separately) in the meeting notes. 

1. __Scope of Work:__

This SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  The scope of this project is to analyze and implement standardization of business processes, project management and training efforts across the DWSRF Program. The analysis will produce a high level ‘As Is’ document that will serve as the project baseline. The team will then formulate a strategic ‘To Be’ plan including recommendations and implement the changes to the program.

### Phase 1 –Current State Process Analysis and Future State

__Detailed Level Requirements__

The first step will be to develop a detailed and common understanding of all the steps across regions that the Virginia DWSRF program completes within six (6) related processes: 

- Construction Application
- Small Engineering Project Funding Support
- Planning and Design Grants
- Active Projects
- EPA Grant Application
- Consent Order

Based on the findings, a desired future state diagram standardizing processes across regions and detailing the new steps for each will be proposed and presented. The future state process will also consider and support the implementation of the new technology system.

This work will require interview with key stakeholders across the business and review of the program’s documentation on existing processes. The work for Phase 1 will culminate in a Summary of Findings and future state process recommendations.

The Vendor will present their key findings and recommendations to the Virginia DWSRF Stakeholders. 

### Phase 2 – Business Process and Project Management Governance Roadmap

__Detailed Level Requirements__

This phase consists of defining the strategy to implement the agreed future state business process recommendations from Phase 1. It will also include the strategic planning and implementation of project management governance based on the DWSRF program goals, future state business processes, identified tools, gaps and opportunities within regions. The roadmap will detail the actions needed and proposed steps to implement standardized business process improvement and governance across the DWSRF Program. It will take into consideration change management and training efforts to ensure successful implementation.

The Vendor will present the strategy and recommendations to the Virginia DWSRF Stakeholders.

### Phase 3 – Documentation and Coaching

__Detailed Level Requirements__

This phase will focus on supporting the implementation of business process and project management governance. It will include creation of key material/documentation to the DWSRF program personnel on the new processes and tools and the project management governance methodology. Supporting material should support the roadmap and include components like: 

- Project management services and methodology
- Project management tools and templates 
- Business Processes
- Roles and Responsibilities
- Communication Plan
- Training Plan

The services to be provided are subject to the following additional provisions:

Effective July 1, 2020, the Code of Virginia requires contractors with the Commonwealth who spend significant time working with or in close proximity to state employees to complete sexual harassment training.  As a result of the new code, VITA and the Department of Human Resource Management (DHRM ) are requiring that all contractors working through the CAI contract complete DHRM's "Preventing Sexual Harassment" training.  This training is available as either a short video or a written transcript on the DHRM website: [https://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/public-interest/contractor-sexual-harassment-training](https://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/public-interest/contractor-sexual-harassment-training). The selected Supplier must agree that any assigned resource will complete the training.

1. __Scheduled Work Hours:__

It is anticipated that most of this work can be accomplished at the Supplier’s location.  If some of the work necessary for this project should be done on-site at the Authorized User’s location, on-site tasks should be identified in the proposed project plan in the SOW.  Supplier staff needed to accomplish these tasks should be identified at the start of the project and will be issued ID and building access cards.  Work hours for on-site staff will be between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday thru Friday (excluding state holidays).  Changes to work hours must have prior approval by the Authorized User.

1. __Facility and Equipment to be provided by Authorized User:__

Authorized User has limited workspace, furniture, and equipment available and only on a temporary basis.  Permanent office space, furniture, and equipment are the responsibility of the Supplier.   For work to be conducted on-site, Authorized User will provide temporary desk space and access to a copier.  Only state-owned equipment may be connected to the agency’s LAN, therefore if the Supplier requires access to the agency network, it must be noted in the SOW (to include the number of staff requiring access, type of access, and reasons), and the Authorized User will provide the necessary equipment and/or access after the kickoff of the project.  Otherwise, Supplier must provide any equipment (e.g., cell phones, personal computers, or laptops) required by the Team.  If the Authorized User is required to provide state-owned computer equipment to the Supplier’s staff it may be necessary to allow additional time for the equipment to be acquired.  Additionally, in order to use state-owned equipment, the Supplier’s staff must follow the Commonwealth’s and Authorized User’s agency computer access policies and procedures. 

The Supplier is responsible for the return of any state-owned equipment at the completion of the project, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing with the authorized user.
