1. __Contract Type: Fixed Price, Deliverable\-based__
2. __Introduction:__

Project History

*On June 2, 2016, the Administration for Children & Families \(ACF\), a division of the U\.S\. Department of Health & Human Services \(HHS\) published the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System final rule, replacing the Statewide and Tribal Automated Child Welfare Information System \(S/TACWIS\) regulations at 45 CFR 1355\.50 through 1355\.59\. ACF defined CCWIS requirements and outlined the need for a CCWIS that would ensure the safety and well\-being of children and all families, strengthen, and preserve families to promote the healthy development of children, and focus on prevention, protection, or other short or long\-term interventions to meet the needs of families\. In December 2018, the Joint Legislative Audit Review Committee \(JLARC\) released the report “Improving Virginia’s Foster Care System” to the Virginia General Assembly\. Many of the challenges identified in that JLARC report would be addressed and remedied once Virginia meets the requirements of the CCWIS final rule\. *

*A CCWIS is a child welfare information system that title IV\-E agencies must develop to support their child welfare program needs\. The CCWIS final rule does the following: \(1\) promotes data sharing with other agencies; \(2\) requires data quality plans; \(3\) reduces mandatory functional requirements; \(4\) allows agencies to build systems tailored to their needs; and \(5\) requires systems to be built modularly\. *

*Specific CCWIS requirements mandate that data be available to support the efficient, effective, and economical administration of the programs\. Specific data reporting requirements include: *

- *Data for ongoing federal child welfare reports\. *
- *Data to support implementation and monitoring of federal child welfare laws, regulations, and policies\. *
- *Case management data to support federal audits and reviews\. *
- *Data to support implementation and monitoring of state or tribal child welfare laws, regulations, policies, practices, reporting requirements, audits, program evaluations, and reviews; and, *
- *Data for the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System\.*

*DFS is currently in the early stages of procurement to contract with a Design, Development, and Implementation \(DDI\) vendor for the new system, to begin work in the late summer or fall of 2024\.  This Human Centered Design project will assist DFS with business process improvement, specifically testing how DFS’s current procedures and processes will work in an updated system\.  The goal of this project is to conduct user experience research, present findings, and provide recommendations identifying areas where DFS procedures can inform DDI efforts for the new system while keeping customization to a minimum\. VDSS expects the Supplier to incorporate feedback from users and community stakeholders while utilizing user experience research and tools, including but not limited to, journey maps and workflows\.  Findings should be presented in a concise manner and supported by evidence drawn from research\. Recommendations should be provided in an agile structure including themes, epics, features, and user stories aimed at ensuring excellent customer services to the families and community stakeholders within the Commonwealth\.*

Business Need

*VDSS DFS promotes and supports the development of healthy families and protects Virginia's children and adults from abuse and neglect\. Our objectives are to:*

- *Develop and manage the skills and professional development of workers, providers and other partners*
- *Meet the needs of customers and comply with federal and state requirements*
- *Administer grants and contracts according to funding source requirements and procedures*

*To prepare the workforce for a modern child welfare information system, this project, VDSS DFS Human Centered Design \(HCD\) Consultant, will review and update established workflows, prepare journey maps for system users and for stakeholders in the community that they encounter, identify pain points in current processes, and provide a roadmap to improve current processes\.  The deliverables listed will facilitate the building of a state\-of\-the\-art child welfare information system that is built with the end user in mind\. This project will follow human centered design principles including, but not limited to, understanding the end users and stakeholders, engaging with end users and stakeholders throughout the process, and testing/revising processes based on end user feedback\. *

*Virginia’s legacy system, Online Automated Services Information System, \(OASIS\), was implemented in 1997 and is currently the system of record for child welfare information\.  The system is utilized by local child welfare front line staff who are responsible for prevention, protection, and permanency cases\.  State VDSS staff utilize the system as well as the staff with the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman\.  Activities include entry and validation of referrals, determination of differential response, supervisory review and approval, case documentation, management of placement providers, service planning, compliance reports, quality assurance reviews, federal reporting, and oversight\.  There are also processes related to child welfare that are done manually or outside the system that will be integrated into the new child welfare information system once developed\.  *

*DFS is in the planning phase of the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System \(CCWIS\) project\. The purpose of the CCWIS project is to retire and replace the current system, OASIS, with a federally compliant and certified, cloud\-hosted modernized child welfare information system that meets 45 CFR 1355\.50 through 1355\.59 and the Commonwealth’s security requirements\.  The planning for the CCWIS project began in 2018, and the estimated timeline of completion of the system modernization is 2027\. *

Project Management and Organizational Structure

*Denise Johnson, Program Manager will be the DSS POC for the project\.  Denise will work with the Supplier Project Manager\.*

1. __Scope of Work:__

This SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service\. 

*VDSS is a state supervised and locally administered department\.  There are 120 Local Departments of Social Services \(LDSS\)\. The primary stakeholders in the development of a CCWIS are LDSS staff including child welfare staff, benefit programs staff, financial services staff, local department management and leadership, and community stakeholders\.  Input from and needs of the LDSS are of the highest priority to the department\.  DFS has reviewed HCD models and considers the best HCD approach to begin well ahead of DDI\.  The best outcomes are achieved when the current state is thoroughly researched, documented, analyzed, and synthesized to understand how best to proceed\.  To do this, DFS seeks a Supplier that will complete this process with user groups \(primary stakeholders and community stakeholders\), as well as provide feedback to the groups to increase acceptance of the path forward\.  DFS’s goal is to develop a well adopted, child welfare information solution that meets the needs of the user groups\.  This scope of work has been developed with that goal in mind\.*

*Supplier will review existing workflows and user stories to familiarize themselves with our current processes and the starting point for development of a CCWIS\.  Supplier will update, where needed, existing workflows for all case types based on insights gained in user experience research and review, user experience sessions, and any programmatic changes since the workflows were initially developed\.    *

*Supplier will map the steps taken by VDSS and LDSS staff and service participants throughout the life of a child welfare case\.  The Supplier will conduct user experience sessions with child welfare staff, benefit programs staff, financial services staff, and service participants, when possible, to develop appropriate personas and empathy maps; and to identify pain points and other insights related to the current case management system and business processes\.  This should include all child welfare case types as well as the eligibility for, and payment of, Title IV\-E reimbursements\. Full documentation of the LDSS financial process is required\.  Discovery should also include CCWIS related items such as the identification of any Child Welfare Contributing Agencies \(CWCA’s\)\. Visit *[*The Children’s Bureau*](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/training-technical-assistance/state-tribal-info-systems/federal-guidance)* for CCWIS program mandates\.  *

*Supplier will develop a roadmap for business process improvement and follow up with users and participants to confirm that the information was documented accurately\.  All program mandates must be considered when evaluating business processes*

*The Supplier will complete story maps to align existing user stories to points in the journey map\.  The Supplier will also identify any gaps\.*

*The Supplier will review and revise, where necessary, user stories to align with the improved business processes and end user needs in a child welfare information system\.  All federal CCWIS regulations must be considered during this review/revision\. The Supplier should conduct follow up sessions with users to confirm that the information was documented correctly\.*

*The Supplier will provide relevant case studies or examples of similar work and must include a plan for engaging with Virginia’s workforce\.*

*The Supplier will provide a proposed schedule and project approach\.*
