Project History

VDOT is seeking a supplier to implement a single solution contract management platform for all aspects of the professional services solicitation and contract administration.

The single solution must provide for managing and monitoring the entire lifecycle of contracts for professional architecture and engineering services (\#1140) which must also include obtaining information needed for procurement, obtaining invoice information, and sending approvals (\#942). 

Professional services are procured statewide within the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), primarily by the following Divisions: 

 

•	Construction 

•	Environmental 

•	Location and Design 

•	Materials 

•	Right of Way and Utilities 

•	Structure and Bridge 

•	Traffic Operations 

•	Transportation and Mobility Planning 

Business Need

Managing professional service contracts involves multiple stages, including procurement, contract award and payment reviews and approvals, renewals, change orders, monitoring and reporting, compliance, issuing and approving task orders, closeout, and performance evaluations. 

Today, these stages often require highly manual and redundant processes. There is no way to easily gain insight into statuses, capacity, or other information needed for the strategic management of professional services consultant contracts, including future planning, quality assurance, and compliance. Furthermore, there is no centralized location for all VDOT staff to view the active, open or closed contracts. As a result, PSPO does not have access to the necessary documents and data on agency professional services consultant contracts. 

 

Project Complexity

Medium to High Risk

Project Management and Organizational Structure

The VDOT Project Manager and the Supplier Project Manager are the main VDOT points of contact and are responsible for day-to-day management of the application solution. 

 

More Specifically: 

1. Supplier shall appoint a Project Manager 
2. The supplier Project Manager shall report to the VDOT Project Manager 
3. VDOT Project Manager shall escalate issues needing supplier attention to the supplier 

Project Manager, who will escalate within supplier’s organization as needed 

1. Supplier Project Manager shall copy the VDOT Project Manager on all 

communications with VDOT staff. 

1. __Scope of Work:__

This SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  

 

In Scope: 

- Supplier will provide the following services: 
- Create replacement PSPO application using Microsoft Dynamics 365 modules available to VDOT as the application platform. 
- Provide information regarding license types and quantity count for the intended solution.  
-  Configure Dynamics 365 to provide all functionality required; minimal custom development is desired outside of native power platform functionality.  See the Fit/Gap of requirements compared to Dynamics functionality for more details regarding the required customizations
- Configure every aspect needed for the final delivered solution including security, user profiles, etc.  
- Utilize the VDOT Dynamics 365 development and test environments. 
- Develop the use cases, user stories, user acceptance test cases and acceptance criteria for testing the new PSPO application, and coordinate user acceptance testing with end user testers. 
- Work with VDOT infrastructure personnel to deploy the new or enhanced PSPO application in VDOT’s Dynamics 365 environment. 
- Follow VDOT standards described in the Enterprise Architecture Supplemental Statement of Requirements attachment. 
- Follow VDOT guidance and recommendations described in the D365 Reference Architecture attachment. 
- Provide three months post-production support.  
- Supplier will provide status updates at a weekly project team meeting to be scheduled by Authorized User, to include status reviews and/or reports describing the release progress, daily/weekly accomplishments, and upcoming tasks for the next reporting period, risks, issues, dependencies, and any other information the Supplier feels is necessary to represent the status of the project. 
- The Authorized User’s external SharePoint site will be utilized for document management in support of implementation.  
- Quality metrics shall be provided by the Supplier, to include, but not limited to:   
- Performance Measurement and Reporting – The Supplier will communicate overall project status, technical issues and accomplishments, schedule performance, cost and schedule issues, and corrective action plans, as appropriate or directed by Authorized User. 
- Testing - The Supplier will communicate number of test cases created, number of test cases executed, number of defects reported, number of defects remediated, and percentage of test cases passed for the System Integration Test and User Acceptance Test. 

 

See VDOT’s Enterprise Architecture Supplemental Statement of Requirements document referenced in the Appendix for VDOT policies, standards, and documentation requirements for application development. A Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fit/Gap Analysis was previously completed  using the Detailed Software Requirements (User Stories and Acceptance Criteria) and is provided as an attachment, which serves as the functional requirements document for the project.

High Level Scope

Project \#942

1. Database to provide a single repository for all contract data and market pay rates.
2. Analysis automation: Proposed tool will:
	1. Include identification of shared subcontractors and personnel across Prime vendors.
	2. Provide recommended contractor class and title based on pay rate, certifications, experience, and previous class and title.
	3. Provide end user with 3 options: recommended class and title, provided class and title, or custom class and title.
3. A web interface for firms to input roster and pay rate information, streamline communication and risk reduction.
4. The collection and analysis of contract invoice data to include consultant personnel and hours billed to each contract.
5. Solution to include reporting on utilization of labor classes and associated rates on any single contract (Allow for quick querying, analysis, and reporting of data which will assist in negotiations and awarding contracts).
6. Data Migration: 
	1. Firms to import their roster data in bulk vs. individual record entry to create library (especially important at go-live), 
	2. Migrate current consultant information listing arising from current/separate interim solution, 
	3. Migrate historical data and reports arising from current/separate interim solution 

Project \#1140

1. Centralized contract management platform with workflows for the procurement, evaluation, selection, negotiation, execution, and administration of professional services contracts. 
2. Document repository and version control for storing contract artifacts. 
3. Storing data fields that are needed for contract administration and future planning. 

The following VDOT system and integrations as defined in the 1140 PSPO Fit Gap.xlsx attachment will be required: 

1. One way integration to the VDOT data warehouse for tracking vendor payments and purchase orders.  Modifications to the existing Cardinal to data warehouse integration are out of scope for this effort.
2. The solution shall have an interface with VDOT's PowerBI or other technologies for creating reports.

The following effort to support the integrations listed below should be included individually as separately priced options, specifically the integrations defined and listed as priority 2 under 1140 PSPO Fit Gap.xlsx attachment. We do not anticipate awarding all of these options, but having this information provides maximum flexibility for system optimization  

1. Civil Rights Database for compliance assurance. 
2. Consultant Performance Evaluation Program for obtaining consultant performance scores 
	1. needed for quality assurance and procurement evaluations. 
3. eVA to post RFP advertisement and notice of award.
4. BidExpress to publish and receive RFP documents and post notice of award.
5. The web interface must be fully responsive and be able to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations on mobile devices and also support touch interactions and allow for the approval of workflow.

See Appendix for detailed requirements, context diagrams, process maps, and EASSOR

Desired State Diagram - \#1140



Future State Diagram:



We may eventually decide to deploy additional Dynamics 365 applications to the same environment, however, for now, the desired state is for this solution to have its own environment.

That said, we would like to prepare the environment to possibly create a complementary application in the same environment in the future. This would include making security groups and roles that are specific to this application (among other things). 

We are open to third party connectors but would prefer a solution that does not use them.
