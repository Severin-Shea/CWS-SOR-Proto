1. __Introduction__

The Office of Regulatory Management \(ORM\) is looking to implement business and technological improvements that will allow efficiency of processes, foster transparency and promote collaboration between <a id="OLE_LINK108"></a>agencies and applicants\. The office is seeking a vendor partner to assess the business process and technical gaps within five \(5\) agencies that manage permits and provide recommendations to improve efficiency\. This includes process improvement, tracking of permits, centralized data and reporting to help provide the transparency needed to understand permit processes and the steps needed to ensure timely decisions\. Finally, as part of the effort, a strategic and technical implementation plan will be defined which includes a roadmap to create an enterprise permitting dashboard for the five agencies\.  As part of this roadmap, the vendor will document the functionality and infrastructure required for the agencies to enter the permitting information for this dashboard\.  Implementation of the dashboard solution is out of scope and will be procured via a separate SOW\. 

1. __Scope of Work__

This SOR defines the Services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service\. The scope of this project is to identify, analyze, and define a strategic plan to build business efficiency and transparency to five \(5\) agency permitting processes\. The analysis should focus on bringing business and technical recommendations to support tracking of permits within regulation deadlines\. The analysis will produce a high level ‘As Is’ document that will serve as the project baseline\. The team will then formulate a strategic ‘To Be’ plan including recommendations and steps to successfully transition to a new, more efficient process with more robust and extensible data and reporting\.

This SOR contains the following key applicable components:

### <a id="OLE_LINK42"></a><a id="OLE_LINK4"></a>Phase 1 – Current State Assessment

<a id="OLE_LINK115"></a>The first step will be to develop a full, common understanding of the current state of five \(5\) Commonwealth agencies that manage permits\.  

- Department of Conservation and Recreation 
- Department of Energy 
- Department of Health
- Department of Transportation
- Marine Resources Commission

Please note that these agencies are subject to change\.

This work will require:

- Interviews with key stakeholders across the business and IT
	- Interviews, questionnaires and/or group discussions conducted with stakeholders
	- PowerPoint presentations and meeting notes
- Review of business processes documentation
	- Documentation of current state workflows based on identified processes
- Review of technical documentation on existing systems/solutions
	- Documentation of current state technical architecture

The work for Phase 1 will culminate in a Summary of Findings to be presented to Authorized User key stakeholders\.  Supplier will present key findings to Authorized User\. It is expected that this effort will help understand how to prioritize focus areas for the Phase 2 work\.

### <a id="OLE_LINK11"></a>Phase 2 – Future State Recommendations 

<a id="OLE_LINK114"></a>This phase will use the deliverable from Phase 1 to complete analysis and design of the future state\. This phase will include:

- <a id="OLE_LINK104"></a>Provide Draft Functional Architecture Design
	- Analysis of the permit processes across the five \(5\) agencies to identify gaps and opportunities for standardization and efficiency 
	- Provide business process recommendations 
	- Define target high\-level future state process
- Provide Draft Technical & Data Architecture Design
	- Analyze data and technology options \- including applications/ software 
	- Recommend hardware for data warehousing 
	- Create a detailed map of the solution’s architecture 
- Suggested Product Lines \(Microsoft \.NET, Oracle Database, Microsoft PowerBI, Toad Intelligence Central, Toad Data Point, Toad for Oracle\)\. These tools are currently used by the enterprise solutions team who will ultimately support the future implementation\. 

Supplier will present the future state design options to Authorized User with a summary of recommendations, including benefits and risks\. It is expected that the outcome of this effort will be a solution selection that forms the basis for <a id="_Int_a441dJyH"></a>the Phase 3 work\.

### <a id="OLE_LINK12"></a>Phase 3 – Implementation Plan

<a id="OLE_LINK113"></a>This phase will use the deliverable from Phase 2 to develop:

- <a id="OLE_LINK105"></a>Final High\-Level Technical & Data Architecture
- Final Functional Architecture \- For each Permit Module
	- Business process recommendations
	- All processing steps 
	- Permit contacts 
	- Target due dates 
	- Required/mandated due dates 
- Actionable Implementation Roadmap based on selected solution\. This plan will include estimated costs and prioritized schedule/roadmap with recommended approaches to implement the plan\. It will also provide recommended staff/roles to support the effort\.

<a id="OLE_LINK13"></a>Supplier will present the final implementation plan to Authorized User including a summary of the plan, highlighting next steps and the goals/benefits to be achieved\.

### Phase 4 – Initial Project Requirements

<a id="OLE_LINK112"></a><a id="OLE_LINK106"></a>This phase focuses on gathering requirements for the initial project\. Supplier will:

- Create a Functional Requirements Document for the agreed initial effort

The services to be provided are subject to the following additional provisions:

1. Effective July 1, 2020, the Code of Virginia requires contractors with the Commonwealth who spend significant time working with or in close proximity to state employees to complete sexual harassment training\.  As a result of the new code, VITA and the Department of Human Resource Management \(DHRM\) are requiring that all contractors working through the CAI contract complete DHRM's "Preventing Sexual Harassment" training\.  This training is available as either a short video or a written transcript on the DHRM website: [https://www\.dhrm\.virginia\.gov/public\-interest/contractor\-sexual\-harassment\-training](https://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/public-interest/contractor-sexual-harassment-training)\. The selected Supplier must agree that any assigned resource will complete the training\.
2. The selected Supplier must agree that any assigned resource will review and conform to the IT Contingent Labor Program \(ITCL\) Contractor Code of Conduct\.  The Code of Conduct can be reviewed on VITA’s website at the following link:

[https://www\.vita\.virginia\.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/supply\-chain/pdf/Contingent\-Worker\-Code\-of\-Conduct\.pdf](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/supply-chain/pdf/Contingent-Worker-Code-of-Conduct.pdf)

1. __Scheduled Work Hours__

While it is anticipated that the majority of this work can be accomplished at the Supplier’s location, some of the work necessary for this project should be done on\-site at the Authorized User’s location to provide maximum knowledge transfer\.  Supplier staff needed to accomplish these tasks should be identified at the start of the project and will be issued ID and building access cards\.  Work hours for on\-site staff will be between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, Monday thru Friday \(excluding state holidays\)\.  Changes to work hours must have prior approval by the Authorized User\.

1. __Facility and Equipment to be provided by Authorized User__

Authorized User has limited workspace, furniture, and equipment available and only on a temporary basis\.  Permanent office space, furniture, and equipment are the responsibility of the Supplier\.   For work to be conducted on\-site, Authorized User will provide temporary desk space and access to a copier\.  Only state\-owned equipment may be connected to the agency’s LAN, therefore if the Supplier requires access to the agency network, it must be noted in the SOW \(to include the number of staff requiring access, type of access, and reasons\), and the Authorized User will provide the necessary equipment and/or access after the kickoff of the project\.  Otherwise, Supplier must provide any equipment \(e\.g\., cell phones, personal computers or laptops\) required by the Team\.  If the Authorized User is required to provide state\-owned computer equipment to the Supplier’s staff it may be necessary to allow additional time for the equipment to be acquired\.  Additionally, in order to use state\-owned equipment, the Supplier’s staff must follow the Commonwealth’s and Authorized User’s agency computer access policies and procedures\.

The Supplier is responsible for the return of any state\-owned equipment at the completion of the project, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing with the Authorized User\.
