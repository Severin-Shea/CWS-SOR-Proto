1. __Introduction:__

__Support Overview__

Authorized User requires assistance in the regular applications and development operations and maintenance of the CEDAR system\. Operations and maintenance activities may include break/fix support, application enhancements, database configurations, user interface updates, GIS mapping modifications, report modifications, and inspection survey changes\. The support includes, as needed, the requirements documentation, system design updates, application / user interface / database evolution, mapping and report adjustments, as well as testing assistance, deployment collaboration, and the requisite business analysis and project management guidance\. 

__Definitions:__

These definitions are applicable to this SOR:

- __Bug –__ defined as an error, flaw, failure or fault in the CEDAR Application that causes it to produce an incorrect result, causes an unexpected result, behaves in unintended way or operates not as designed\. 
- __Enhancement –__ defined as any product change, improvement or upgrade that increases software or hardware capabilities beyond the original specifications\.
- __Minor Enhancement – __defined as__ __a product change, improvement or upgrade that increases software or hardware capabilities beyond the original specifications, however it has limited risk and little or no impact to the applications performance\.
- __Hot Fixes – __defined as__ __a code repair or upgrade to an application that must be applied to Production as soon as possible to prevent application performance denigration\. 
- __Done__ – defined as every task has been coded to standards, reviewed, unit tested, integrated with application, documented and meets the Product Owner’s expectation\. 
- __Finished__ – defined as reached an end of an activity, does not requiring more work, no longer doing it or dealing with it\.

__Current State __

Authorized User currently maintains numerous enterprise systems for the agency with limited resources and many responsibilities\. In order to meet the business needs and mandated requirements for updates to CEDAR, additional support is needed to supplement existing technical staff\.

__Business Need__

The CEDAR system has recently been updated with new modules and enhancements\. As with any significant change to a system, ongoing operations and maintenance is expected to be necessary in order to support the business needs of the system\. As the system is exercised, refinements and efficiencies will be discovered by users for incorporation into their business processes\. These refinements and efficiencies should be incorporated as soon as reasonably possible and practical to ensure mandated agency requirements are met and business operations run effectively\.

VDOT will appoint up to one support manager\.

More specifically: 

- Supplier will appoint a vendor support manager;

__Severity Level II \- Serious Business Impact *– *__Must be fixed in a relatively short period of time\. Problems that seriously interfere with reasonable use of the application, however a work around does exist but is awkward, difficult to perform or impacts performance\. VDOT is experiencing significant or degraded loss of service from the CRM solution \(e\.g\. overall performance deviates from the goal greater than 10%, increase change of application failure, failure to recognize and report significant error conditions\)\. This level applies to critical bugs\. 

__Severity Level III \- Minor Business Impact__ – Needs to be fixed in a reasonable timeframe\. A medium\-to\-low impact problem that limits the ability to use a major functionality of the application where an easy workaround exists; or that limits the ability to use a non\-critical functionality of the system\. 

__Severity Level IV \- No Business Impact or Enhancement Request __– Needs to be addressed in next maintenance release or enhancement request; are cosmetic in nature and which do not affect normal application use\.
