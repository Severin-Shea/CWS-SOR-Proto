Final acceptance of services provided under the SOW will be based upon acceptance of monthly deliverables for base level support and approval of hours worked on T&M basis.

For T&M work, the Acceptance Criteria for this solution will be based on a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) designed by Supplier and Authorized User and accepted by the Authorized User. Supplier will follow proper UAT practices and will ensure all functionality required for the solution has been delivered. If additional requirements outside of the RTM come from the Authorized User during UAT those will be moved into the backlog and require additional T&M. The Supplier will provide the Authorized User with a test plan and acceptance checklist based on the mutually developed and agreed upon UAT plan.

Service(s) shall be deemed accepted when the Authorized User determines that such Service(s) meets the Requirements set forth in this SOW. If applicable, Supplier shall be responsible for ensuring that any individual Deliverable functions properly with any other Related Deliverable provided pursuant to the same SOW. Should a previously Accepted Deliverable require further modification in order to work properly with any other Related Deliverable, Supplier shall be responsible for all costs associated with such modification.
