Project History

VITA and VDEM are administering Virginia’s participation in the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program \(SLCGP\), under which a combination of federal grant money and state\-provided matching funds will be used to assist state and local public entities with improving their cybersecurity posture\. 80% of the grant fund will be allocated for local public entities and within that 80%, 25% is specifically designated for rural localities \(defined by federal law as a population less than 50,000 that has not been designated in the most recent decennial census as an “urbanized area” by the Secretary of Commerce\)\.  For further information on the SLCGP generally, see CISA and FEMA's websites:

	[State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program | CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/state-and-local-cybersecurity-grant-program) 

	[State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program | FEMA\.gov](https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/state-local-cybersecurity-grant-program)

For further information on Virginia’s participation in the SLCGP, see VITA’s website:

	[Federal Cybersecurity Grants | Virginia IT Agency](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/information-security/grant-programs/)

The [Virginia Cybersecurity Planning Committee](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/information-security/cyber-awareness/cybersecurity-programs/federal-cybersecurity-grants/virginia-cybersecurity-planning-committee/) has developed a [Virginia Cybersecurity Plan](https://www.vita.virginia.gov/media/vitavirginiagov/commonwealth-security/pdf/meetings/2022-Virginia-Cybersecurity-Plan.pdf), which has been approved by the federal government and is a prerequisite for using SLCGP funding\.  The Plan contains Virginia’s objectives for the program and also identifies a set of priority objectives\.  

Year one funding is already available to Virginia\.  The intent is to prioritize localities conducting a needs / gap assessment against the program objectives\.  

The intent of this SOR is to identify and vet suppliers who will perform a needs / gap assessment of specified locality’s environment resulting in an artifact \(the Findings and Recommendations Report described below\)\.  The produced artifact is expected to be utilized as a baseline for the locality and as a guide and precursor for determining what cyber security services will be implemented through the SLCGP as further funding uses are approved\.  VITA reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result of this SOR and our expectation is that at least one hundred five \(105\) assessments will be completed by one or more suppliers\. However this is an estimate, and the actual quantity of assessments awarded may be more or less than those shown\. 

Authorized User will determine the in\-scope localities for assessments before executing any resulting SOW\(s\)\.  

Business Need 

This SOR requires:

- an overall review of a specified locality’s current capabilities as compared to the goals and objectives described in the Virginia Cybersecurity Plan, 
- An assessment of the capability level of the organization in its current state and,
- Development of recommended security artifacts to support operationalization of the Virginia Cybersecurity Plan\.

__10\. Scope of Work:__

This Statement of Requirements \(SOR\) defines the Cybersecurity Plan Capability Assessment Support required by the Virginia IT Agency \(VITA\)\. This SOR requires an overall review of specified locality’s current approach for meeting the goals and objectives outlined in the Cybersecurity Plan, as well as development of recommended security artifacts to support operationalization of the Cybersecurity Plan\. 

The Supplier will review specified locality’s current state capability against the following capabilities using a standard list of topics provided by VITA: 

- Inventory and control of technology assets, software and data
- Threat monitoring
- Threat protection and prevention
- Data recovery and continuity
- Security assessment  


In order to complete the current state assessment, the Supplier will be expected to conduct interviews with the locality’s personnel, and request and review a locality’s existing documentation and policies that support the Virginia Cybersecurity Plan goals and objectives\. Supplier is expected to use its security expertise to ask the right questions and follow\-ups so as to ensure a useful review\.  Supplier is *not* being engaged to conduct technical tests of security systems or measures\.

After this initial evaluation, the Supplier will generate a Findings and Recommendations Report using a standard template provided by VITA\. The draft report is provided as an attachment to this SOR\. The report will describe the current state and also recommend actions to improve the locality’s capabilities, such as initial development of missing governance artifacts \(e\.g\., Security Management plan, updated policies, updated standards, controls frameworks, capabilities, charters, etc\.\) as prioritized by senior leadership for this initial phase of this effort\.  Prioritizations should focus on greatest impact, while keeping in mind feasibility of near\-term and program objectives, and may include but are not limited to:

- Manage, monitor, and track information systems, applications, and user accounts;
- Monitor, audit, and track network traffic and activity;
- Enhance the preparation, response, and resiliency of information systems, applications, and user accounts;
- Implement a process of continuous cybersecurity risk factors and threat mitigation\. practices prioritized by degree of risk;
- Adopt and use best practices and methodologies to enhance cybersecurity \(references NIST\);
- Implement multi\-factor authentication, implement enhanced logging, data encryption for data at rest and in transit, end use of unsupported/end of life software and hardware that are accessible from the Internet, prohibit use of known/fixed/default passwords and credentials, ensure the ability to reconstitute systems \(backups\), migration to the \.gov internet domain;
- Promote the delivery of safe, recognizable, and trustworthy online services, including using the

\.gov internet domain;

- Ensure continuity of operations including by conducting exercises;
- Identify and mitigate any gaps in the cybersecurity workforces, enhance recruitment and retention efforts, and bolster the knowledge, skills, and abilities of personnel \(reference to NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity\);
- Ensure continuity of communications and data networks in the event of an incident involving communications or data networks;
- Assess and mitigate, to the greatest degree possible, cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity threats relating to critical infrastructure and key resources, the degradation of which may impact the performance of information systems within the specified locality;
- Enhance capabilities to share cyber threat indicators and related information between the eligible locality and the Authorized User;
- Implement an information technology and operational technology modernization cybersecurity review process that ensures alignment between information technology and operational technology cybersecurity objectives;
- Develop and coordinate strategies to address cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity threats\.

Suppliers should provide a __fixed price per assessmen__t in their response\.  As in\-scope localities will be determined prior to SOW execution, Suppliers should also include any assumptions that could impact their price per assessment\. The final total price of the SOW\(s\) will be finalized during Supplier negotiations once the number of in\-scope assessments is determined\.  Please review the attached Appendix – Locality Characteristics for estimates of size and type of public bodies that have requested the assessments\.  Respondents may propose a tiered pricing approach per assessment based on factors provided\.  

1. __Period of Performance__

The period of performance for any resulting SOW\(s\) will be determined based on the number of assessments in scope to the SOW\(s\) and finalized during supplier negotiations\.  VITA’s initial vision is to have all of the assessments completed within an estimated 12 week timeframe or as mutually agreed upon during supplier negotiations\.  Suppliers responding to this solicitation should provide estimates for the number of assessments they can complete in a 12 week period and any associated assumptions\.
