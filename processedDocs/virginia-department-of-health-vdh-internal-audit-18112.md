1. __Contract Type:__ Fixed Price, Deliverable-based
2. __Introduction:__

Virginia Department of Health (VDH)’s mission is to protect the health and promote the well-being of all people in Virginia with the vision of becoming the healthiest state in the nation.

VDH consists of the Central Office located in Richmond, VA with five (5) Regional Districts and a total of 35 local health districts located within the five regions.  

Project History

VDH has about 45 sensitive critical systems and a Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2024 IT Audit Plan on file with VITA/Commonwealth Security and Risk Management (CSRM).  VDH wants to ensure compliance with the current versions of the COV’s IT Security Standards (SEC530) as well as ensure compliance with COV’s IT Security IT Audit Standards (SEC502).  The Commonwealth of Virginia’s Information Security Standard, SEC 530 (Security Standard) adopts the Information System Security Control Families (families) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Security Standard uses these families to organize the controls that the Commonwealth is required to apply to its information systems. 

According to NIST, a family “contains security controls related to the general security topic of the family. Security controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision, manual processes, actions by individuals, or automated mechanisms implemented by information systems and devices.”

Business Need

The Office of Internal Audit’s IT Department, VDH Office of Internal Audit requires auditing of its systems in accordance with the FY24 IT Audit Plan on file with VITA. 

The systems in scope for this SOR are:

- OEPI – ELR Database (ELR) 
- OEPI – HIV Counseling, Testing & Referral (HIV-CTR) 
- OEPI – VASE/VASE\+ 
- OFHS – Care Connection for Children System Users Network (CCC-SUN) – if time permits

The data owners, system owners, and VDH’s Office of Compliance and Security have identified these systems as sensitive.  As such, the Commonwealth’s IT Security Standard requires a SEC530 IT Security Compliance audit once every three years.

VDH requires final audit deliverables by June 30, 2024.

Project Complexity

Project complexity and risk are assessed as moderate.

Project Management and Organizational Structure

VDH Internal Audit Director will be the lead for this effort.  The Supplier will provide deliverables to the Audit Director.  

1. __Scope of Work: __

This SOR defines the services required by Authorized User in support of the Project/Service.  In connection with the Services, the Supplier will perform the following tasks in the course of the audit: 

A.	IT Security Audit Process

1. Perform the IT Security Audit in a manner to comply with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Standard for Consulting Services as it relates to this specific IT Security Audit activity, such that general work processes, documentation standards, work paper formats, and report contents are required to comply with the above professional standards.  
2. The Supplier will provide evidence of most recently completed external peer review that demonstrates general compliance with auditing standards.  
3. Work directly with Authorized User staff to collect the information necessary to complete the IT Security Audit.  For tracking and reporting of audit requests, maintain a list of items requested from Authorized User with item description, date requested, name of requestor, name of responsible Authorized User staff, due date agreed to, date received, and additional comments. 
4. Conduct an entrance conference with appropriate Authorized User management to discuss IT Security Audit scope, limitations, expectations, and timeframes.
5. Compile a list of findings including the IT Security Audit Program step number, number, and title of the audit point in the IT Security Audit report in which the finding is included, a description of the finding, and the control number tested. 
6. Prepare and provide a draft IT Security Audit report to Authorized User.  Detailed findings may be grouped into a higher-level audit point in the report if they share a common subject.  Audit points must include easily identifiable elements of a finding: condition, criteria, cause, effect, and recommendation. 
7. Schedule and hold an exit conference with Authorized User management to present the draft IT Security Audit report.  Within 10 business days after providing the draft report, meet with Authorized User staff responsible for corrective actions to discuss the draft report and findings and to obtain a written corrective action plan with responsible parties and estimated date of completion for inclusion in the final report.
8. Complete and submit the final report to Authorized User.

B.	Approach

1. <a id="_Hlk129859286"></a>IT Security Audit Program: Supplier should develop an IT Security Audit Program for review and approval by Authorized User.  The approved program will become the scope document and supersede any scoping in this document.  The program should include a planning phase, which will be used to perform discovery of systems and devices in scope and subsequently, the development or updating of the Test Plan. If discovery identifies additional scope information that changes the Supplier’s SOW and any subsequent Change Orders are required, they will supersede this document as the agreed upon scope.
2. Control Frameworks: 
	- VITA IT Security Standard SEC 530 should be used as the guideline for this IT Security Audit.
	- Only application specific controls from SEC 530 be considered in the scope.  Agency level IT General Controls will not be included in the scope.
3. Period of Scope: From July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024
4. Population Sampling: It is expected that the Supplier should perform IT Security Audit procedures based on a minimum of the lesser of 10% or 30 items sampling approach and therefore, 100% of the population should not be expected to be tested.  For example, if 50 servers are within the overall scope, Supplier may sample 10% of servers to perform testing.
5. Control Testing Methods: Testing should confirm the design of controls in place. Supplier may perform the following activities to evaluate IT security controls: interviews, observation of control activities, inspection of control evidence. inspection of policies and procedures, and utilize automated testing tools to verify technical information. 
6. __Period of Performance:__

Delivery of all products and services defined in the Statement of Work will occur within 5 months of project execution date and must be completed by June 30, 2024.
